<p class="ph2">THE JUGGLER.</p>

<hr class="tiny">
<h2 class="nobreak">I.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mystery</span> was not far to seek, surely. The great
gneissoid crags were moulded by the heat from subterranean
fires in remote, unimagined æons. From
the deep coves, now so heavily wooded, the once
submerging waters had long ago ebbed, following
undreamed-of lures, drawn seaward or skyward,
or engulfed in still lower depths,—who can say?—leaving
the ripple-marks on their rocky confines
to tell of their being. In the middle of the
bridle-path, touched by every careless passing foot,
lay a splintered sandstone slab, the fracture revealing
a cluster of delicate, cylindrical, stem-like
petrifactions, thus preserving, with the comprehensive
significance of nature, so slight a thing as the
record of the life of a worm long ages agone, in
these fossil traces of primordial vermicular burrowings,
here in the midst of a scene that was itself as
a register of those stupendous revolutions the incidents
of which were the subsidence of vast oceans,
and the emergence of continents, and the development
of the mighty agencies that made and lifted
the mountains. All the visible world gave token of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
the inexplicable past of creation, of the unrevealed
future,—those thoughts of God which are very
deep thoughts. And yet, in the blunting of daily
use, the limitations of dull observation, the unquestioning
acceptance of the accustomed routine
of nature, there might seem naught before the eye
which was not plainly manifest,—mountain, rock,
forest,—the mere furniture of existence. One
hardly analyzes the breath of life as it is breathed;
even when considered as nearly twenty-one per
cent. of oxygen to seventy-nine per cent. of nitrogen,
are we aught the wiser, for whence comes it,
and alas, why does it go? To those creatures of
a day, busy with the day, it seemed that mystery
and doubt and troublous questioning had first
entered Etowah Cove in the guise of a vagrant
juggler, their earliest experience of a modern
exponent of his most ancient craft.</p>

<p>The light that timidly flickered out of the schoolhouse
windows into the bosky depths of the encompassing
wilderness, one night, marked a new
era in the history of the Cove. It was the first
“show” that had ever been given nearer than Colbury,
some forty miles distant, unless one might
make so bold as to include in the term camp-meetings
and revivals, weddings and funerals. The
walls of the little log house had hitherto echoed
naught more joyous than sermons and “experience
meetings,” or sounds of scholastic discipline,
or the drone of the juvenile martyr reluctantly
undergoing education. The place had long been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
closed to secular uses, for only at infrequent intervals
was the school opened, and a drought of instruction
still held sway. To the audience who
had been roused from the dull routine of the fireside
by the startling and unprecedented announcement
that a stranger-man, staying at old Tubal
Cain Sims’s cabin, was going to give a “show”
in the schoolhouse, the flutter of excitement, the
unwonted nocturnal jaunt hither, the joyous anticipation,
were almost tantamount to the delighted
realization. The benches were arranged as for
worship or learning, and were crowded with old
and young, male and female, the reckless and
barefoot, the neuralgic and shod. The men, unkempt
and unshaven, steadily chewed their quids
of tobacco, and now and then spat upon the floor
and grinned at one another. The women conserved
a certain graver go-to-meeting air, doubtless
the influence of the locality, but were visibly
fluttered. Occasionally a big sunbonnet turned
toward another, and whispered gossip ensued, as
before the first hymn is given out. The lighted
tallow candles in small tin sconces against the
walls, and a kerosene lamp on the table on the
platform, cast a subdued and mellow light over
the assemblage. It flickered up to the brown
rafters, where the cobwebs were many; it converted
the tiny dirt-incrusted panes of the windows
to mirror-like use, and was reflected from the
dense darkness outside with duplications of sections
of the audience; it shone full and bright on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
tall, athletic figure of the juggler, appearing suddenly
and swiftly from a side door, and bowing
low in the centre of the platform with an air of
great deference and courtesy to his silent and
spellbound audience.</p>

<p>He might have astonished more sophisticated
spectators. Instead of wearing the ordinary evening
dress or the costume of the Japanese or Hindoo,
according to the usual wont of conjurers, he was
clad in a blue flannel shirt and a black-and-red
blazer, and his blue knickerbockers and long blue
hose on his muscular legs impressed the mountaineers
as a ballet costume might have done, could
they have conceived of such attenuations of attire.
A russet leather belt was drawn tightly around his
slender waist, and they gazed at him from the tip
of his dark sleek red-brown hair, carefully parted
in the middle, to the toes of his pointed russet
shoes with an amazement which his best feat might
fail to elicit. His air of deep respect reassured
them in a measure, for they could not gauge the
covert banter in his tone and the mockery in his
eyes as his sonorous “Ladies and gentlemen” rang
forth in the little building. And there was something
more in his eyes—of reddish-brown tint like
his hair—that the mockery and banter could not
hide; for these were transient, and the other—a
thought with a fang. It might have been anxiety,
remorse, turmoil of mind, fear,—one might hardly
say,—plainly to be seen, yet not discerned. Below
his eyes, above his cheekbones, that showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
their contour, for his face was thin, were deep blue
circles, and that unmistakable look of one who has
received some serious sudden shock. But the spirit
of the occasion was paramount now, and he was
as unconscious of the lack in his accoutrements in
the estimation of the mountaineers as they were
of how the bare feet of sundry of his spectators
offended his prejudices in favor of <i>chaussure</i>.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here
to witness some of those feats which are variously
ascribed to charlatanry, to skill or sleight of hand,
or to certain traffic with supernatural agencies.
Those which I shall have the honor to exhibit to
this select audience I shall not explain; in fact,”
with a twinkle of the eye, “some of them are inexplicable,
and so may they long continue! I have
not thought best to avail myself of the services of
an assistant, who is generally, I grieve to say,
among most of those of my profession, a mere
trickster and accomplice, and therefore you will
have the evidence of your eyes to the fact that
every feat which I perform this evening is absolutely
genuine.”</p>

<p>His spirit of rodomontade had reached its limit.
Perhaps some of the more finely strung sensibilities
in the audience appraised the ridicule in his
intention, despite the masquerade of his manner,
for a glance of resentment kindled here and there;
but before the awed and open-mouthed majority
had drawn a breath or relaxed a muscle he changed
his tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>“I have selected a young man from amongst
you,” he said, quite naturally and pleasantly, “to
aid me in finding properties, as it were, for my
entertainment; for in apology be it spoken, I am
not prepared in any respect for an exhibition of
this sort. He has, at my request, borrowed for
me this bayonet.” He took from the table drawer
the weapon, newly cleaned and glistening, and
looked at it narrowly as he stood before them on
the platform. “I should say it has seen service.
Can this gentleman tell me whether it is from a
Federal or a Confederate gun?”</p>

<p>He stepped down suddenly from the platform
and handed the bayonet to a strong-featured,
stern-looking old mountaineer who had earlier regarded
him with dawning disfavor.</p>

<p>“It’s from a Rebel weepon,” the veteran said
succinctly.</p>

<p>“It’s off a Yankee Springfiel’,” a voice came
from the other side of the room.</p>

<p>“Enfiel’,” said the first speaker doggedly.</p>

<p>“Springfiel’,” contradicted his invisible antagonist
tersely.</p>

<p>Once more, “Enfiel’.”</p>

<p>And again out of the shadow, “Springfiel’.”</p>

<p>And the juggler became aware that he had
waked up the political dog of the region.</p>

<p>“They are equally digestible,” he declared, resuming
his place on the platform. “I believe I’ll
swallow it.” And so he did.</p>

<p>For one moment there was an intense silence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
while the petrified audience gazed in motionless
astonishment at the juggler. Then arose a great
tumult of voices; there was a violent movement at
the rear of the room; a bench broke down, and in
the midst of the commotion, with a gay cry of
“Hey! Presto!” the juggler apparently drew the
bayonet from out his throat and triumphantly held
it up before the people.</p>

<p>An increasing confusion of sounds greeted him.
Screams of delighted mirth came from the younger
portion of the audience, and exclamations hardly
less flattering from the laughing elders. But ever
above the babel terrified shrieks, shrill and clamorous,
rose higher and higher, and the juggler
frowned with sudden sharp annoyance when he
distinguished the fact that an elderly woman was
crying out that these were the works of the devil,—that
here was Satan, and that she would not bide
easy till he was bound, neck and heels together,
and cast forth into the river. He was not usually
devoid of humane sentiments, but he felt vastly relieved
when she fell into strong hysterics, and was
carried, still shrieking, out to the ox-cart, whence,
despite the closed doors and windows, over and
over again those weird, unearthly cries were borne
in to the audience, as the yoking of the steers for
the homeward journey was in progress.</p>

<p>The juggler was out of countenance. “Ladies
and gentlemen,” he said, with indignation coloring
his face to the roots of his hair, “these things are
done for amusement. If they fail to amuse, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
fail altogether. I will go on, or, if you desire,
your money will be refunded at the door.”</p>

<p>“Lawd, naw, bub!” exclaimed a toothless old
fellow, bent nearly double as he sat on a front
bench, his clasped hands between his knees. “We-uns
want ter view all ye know how ter do,—all
ye know how ter do, son.”</p>

<p>Here and there reassuring voices confirmed the
spokesman, and as the discomfited juggler turned
to the table drawer, resolving on something less
bloody-minded, he heard a vague titter from that
portion of the building in which, being young, he
had already observed that the greater number of
personable maidens were seated.</p>

<p>None so dread ridicule as the satirist. He
whirled around, his heart swelling indignantly, his
eyes flashing fire, to perceive, advancing down the
aisle, a fat woman in a gigantic sunbonnet, which,
however, hardly obscured her broad, creased, dimpled
face, a brown calico dress wherein the waist-line
must ever be a matter of conjecture, and a
little shoulder-shawl of bright red-and-yellow
plaid. She slowly approached him with something
of steel glittering in her hands, and at his amazed
and dumfounded expression of countenance the
girlish cachinnation which he so resented broke
forth afresh.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon?” he said more than once, as
from his elevation he sought to catch her request.
A single tooth of the upper register, so to speak,
however ornamental, did not serve to render more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
distinct the fat woman’s wheeze, in which she
sought to articulate her desire that he should forthwith
swallow her big shears, so fascinated was she
by the evidence he had given of his proficiency in
the arts of the impossible.</p>

<p>“Certainly, with pleasure,—always anxious to
oblige the ladies,” he protested, with a return of
his covert mockery, as he bowed after a dancing-class
fashion, and received from her fat creased
hands the great domestic implement with its dangling
steel chain. “Ladies and gentlemen,” he
declared, with his hand upon his heart, as she subsided,
shaking with laughter, on the front bench,
“I cannot refrain from expressing my flattered
sense of this mark of the confidence reposed in me
by this distinguished audience, as well as by the
estimable lady who is so willing to offer her shears
on the altar of science. She is not satisfied with
the warlike bayonet. She desires to see the same
experiment, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, on a pair of shears,
which are devoted to the tender-hearted and affable
uses of the work-basket, filled with the love of
home and gentle fireside associations, and—and—and
other domestic scraps. The rivet is a trifle
loose, and I hope I may not be forced to disgorge
the blades separately.”</p>

<p>He was holding up the scissors as he spoke these
words, so that all could see them; the next moment
they had disappeared down his throat, as it
were, and the astounded audience sat as if resolved
into eyes, staring spellbound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>When, a few minutes later, with his cabalistic
phrase, “Hey! Presto!” he drew from his open red
mouth the shears dangling at the end of the rattling
steel chain, which the audience had just seen him
swallow, the clamor of exclamations again arose,
for the accepted methods of applause had not yet
penetrated to the seclusions of Etowah Cove; but
there was in this manifestation of surprise so definite
a quaver of fear that certain lines of irritation
and anxiety corrugated the smooth brow of the
young prestidigitator. The tumultuous amazement
of the spectators seemed as if it were too great to
be realized all at once, and with the sight of the
performance anew of the impossible feat, which
should have served as reassurance, it degenerated
into downright terror which held the possibilities
of panic. The idea of panic suggested other possibilities.
Albeit their unsophisticated state was
highly favorable to the development of emotions of
boundless astonishment and absolute credulity, he
realized that it was not unattended by some personal
danger. After the suggestion of being bound
hand and foot and thrown into the river, the juggler
was more than once unpleasantly reminded—for
he was a man of some reading—of certain fellow
craftsmen in the mists of centuries agone,
whose wondrous skill in the powers of air, earth,
and fire, though great enough to be deemed unlawful
traffic with the devil, could not avail to prevent
their own earthly elements from going up in smoke
and flame, and thus contributing ethereally to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
great reserves of material nature. He was here
alone, far from help, among the most ignorant and
lawless people he had ever seen; and if their dislocated
ideas of necromancy and unlawful dealing
with the devil should take a definite hold upon
them, he might be summarily dealt with as an act
of religion, and the world none the wiser. Such
disaster had befallen better jugglers, sooth to say,
in more civilized communities than Etowah Cove.
He sought to put this thought from him, for his
heart was sufficiently stout of fibre, but determined
that he would not again be diverted from his intention
of substituting less blood-curdling feats for
the usual experiments with knives and swords.
He preserved a calm face and debonair manner, as
he carefully wiped the shears free from supposititious
moisture on a folded white table-cloth that
lay on the platform, and stepped down, and with
an elaborate bow presented them to their chuckling
and gratified owner.</p>

<p>“Jane Ann Sims wouldn’t keer if the Old Nick
hisself war ter set up his staff in the Cove, ef he
hed some news ter tell or a joke ter crack, or some
sorter gamesome new goin’s-on that she hed never
hearn tell on afore,” whispered a lean, towering,
limp sunbonnet to its starch and squatty neighbor.</p>

<p>“An’ <i>she</i> hard on ter fifty odd years old!” said
the squatty sunbonnet, malignantly accurate.</p>

<p>As the juggler stepped back to the platform he
took up the table-cloth and shook it out, that they
might all be assured that there was nothing concealed
in its folds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“Now, ladies and gentlemen,” he said, taking
heart of grace and his former manner of covert
half-banter and mock politeness together, “we all
know that it is by the action of the sun on the soil,
and the dew and the rain, that the seeds of plants
germinate and the green herb grows for the service
of men. I propose to show you now a small agricultural
experiment which I venture to hope will
be of special interest to this assembly, as most of
you are engaged in the noble pursuit of tilling the
soil, when other diversions cannot by any means
be had.”</p>

<p>As he clattered off his sentences, garnished now
and then with trite bits of Latin, the solemn,
stolid, uncomprehending faces ministered to a certain
mocking humor which he had, and which was
now becoming a trifle bitter with the reluctant
realization of a lurking danger.</p>

<p>“Will some gentleman come forward and tell
me what kind of a seed this is?”</p>

<p>He held the small object up between his finger
and thumb for a moment, but no one approached.
He perceived in a sort of helpless dismay that the
dread of him was growing. He was fain to step
down from the platform and hand the seed to the
old man on the front bench, whose bleared eyes
were glittering with delight in the greatest sensation
that had ever fallen to his lot; for the juggler
judged that of all the audience he was nearest the
masculine counterpart of the progressive Jane Ann
Sims. The old man, in his circle, was not a person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
of consideration nor accustomed to deference.
He was all the more easily flattered to be thus
singled out by the juggler, the conspicuous cynosure
of all eyes, to give his judgment and pronounce
upon the identity of the seed. The love
of notoriety is a blasting passion, deadening all
considerations of the conformable. Even in these
secluded wilds, even in the presence of but a handful
of his familiars, even in the lowly estate of a
cumberer of the ground, lagging superfluous, it
smote Josiah Cobbs. He rose to his feet, whirled
briskly around, and, with a manner founded on
the sprightly style of the juggler, yet compounded
with the diction of the circuit rider, exclaimed,
“Yea, my brethren, this hyar be a seed,—yea, it
be actially a persimmon seed, though so dry I
ain’t so sure whether or not it’ll ever sot off ter
grow like a fraish one might. Yea, my brethren,
I ain’t sure how long—ah—this hyar persimmon
seed hev—ah—been kem out o’ the persimmon.
Yea”—</p>

<p>He progressed not beyond this point, for the
audience had no mind to be entertained with the
rhetoric of old Josiah Cobbs, resenting his usurpation
of so prominent a position, and his presumption
in undertaking to address the meeting. Certain
people in this world are given to understand
that although their estate in life be not inferior
to that of their neighbors, humility becomes them,
and a low seat is their appropriate station. More
than one sunbonnet had rustlingly communed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
another as to the fact that Josiah Cobbs would
hardly be heard at an experience meeting, the
state of his humble soul not interesting the community.
So simultaneous a storm of giggles swept
the cluster of girls as to demonstrate that their
gravity was of the same tenuous quality as that of
their age and sex elsewhere. It was wonderful
that they did not sustain some collapse, and this
furnishes a pleasing commentary upon the strength
of the youthful diaphragm. The men exchanged
glances of grim derision, and finally one, with
the air of a person not to be trifled with, rose up
and stretched out his hand for the bewitched seed,
forgetting for the moment all his quondam qualms
of distrust.</p>

<p>Josiah Cobbs rendered it up without an instant’s
hesitation. Precious as was the opportunity in his
eyes, preëmpted by his own courage, his was not
the type which makes resistance. The hand to
despoil him had hardly need to be strong. The
will to have what he possessed was sufficient for
his pillage. He hardly claimed the merits appertaining
to the pioneer. He stood meekly by as
the seed was passed from one set of horny finger-tips
to another, and the dictum, “It’s a persimmon
seed, stranger,” was repeated with a decision
which implied no previous examination.</p>

<p>“A persimmon seed, is it?” said the juggler
airily, receiving it back. “Now, gentlemen, you
see that there is nothing in this pail of earth but
good pulverized soil.” He passed his fingers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
through the surface, shaking them daintily free
from the particles afterward, while the hands of
the practical farmers went boldly grappling down
to the bottom with no thought of dirt. “You see
me plant this persimmon seed. There! Now I
throw over the pail this empty cloth,—let it stand
up in a peak so as to give the seed air; now I
place the whole on the table, where you can all
see it and assure yourselves that no one goes near
it. While awaiting developments I shall try to
entertain you by singing a song. It may be unknown
to you—yet why this suggestion in the
presence of so much culture?—that in the days of
eld certain wandering troubadours came to be in
some sort men of my profession. In the intervals
of minstrelsy they entertained and astonished their
audiences with feats of the miraculous,—strange
exploits of legerdemain and such light pastimes,—and
were therefore termed <i>jongleurs</i>. I shall
seek to follow my distinguished Provençal predecessors
in the gay science <i>haud passibus æquis</i>,
and pipe up as best I may.”</p>

<p>There was a pause while the juggler, standing
at one end of the platform, seemed to run over in
his mind the treasures of his <i>répertoire</i>. The mellow
lamplight shone in his reflective brown eyes,
cast down as he twisted one end of the long red-brown
mustache, and again thrown up as if he
sought some recollection among the old rafters.
These had the rich reserves of color characteristic
of old wood, and the heavy beams of oak showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
all their veinous possibilities in yellow and brown
fibrous comminglements against the deep umber
shadows of the high peak of the roof. The cobwebs
adhering here and there had almost the consistency
of a fabric, so densely woven they were.
One pendulous gauze fragment moved suddenly
without a breath of air, for a light living creature
had run along the beam beneath it, and now stood
looking down at the audience with a glittering eye
and a half-spread bat-like wing,—a flying squirrel,
whose nest was secreted in the king-post and
entered from the outside. So still was the audience,—the
grizzled, unkempt men, the sunbonneted
women, even the giggling girls in the corner,—he
might have been meditating a downward
plunge into the room.</p>

<p>Then slightly frowning, but smiling too, the
juggler began to sing.</p>

<p>It was a cultivated voice that rang out in the
measures of “My Pretty Jane,”—a tenor of good
range, true, clear, sweet, with a certain romantic
quality that was in some sort compelling and effective.
He sang well. Not that the performance
would have been acceptable considered as that of
a high-grade professional, yet it was far too good
for a mere parlor amateur. The rich, vibrant
voice, without accompaniment,—grotesque inadequacy
to his mind,—filled the little building with
a pathetic, penetrating sweetness, and the whole
method of rendering the ballad was characterized
by that elaborate simplicity and restrained precision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
so marked in professional circles, so different
from the enthusiastic <i>abandon</i> of the reckless
home talent.</p>

<p>It fell flat in Etowah Cove. There were people
in the audience who, if they could not sing, were
intimately persuaded that they could; and after
all, that is the essential element of satisfaction.
The modulation, the delicate shades of expression,
the refinement of style, were all lost on the majority;
only here and there a discerning ear was
pricked up, appreciating in the concord of sweet
sounds something out of the common. But there
was no sign of approval, and in the dead silence
which succeeded the final roulade, coming so trippingly
off, the juggler showed certain symptoms
of embarrassment and discomfiture. One might
easily perceive from the deft assurance of his exploits
of sleight of hand that the value he placed
upon them was far cheaper than his estimate of
his singing. It was a susceptible sort of vanity that
could be hurt by the withheld plaudits of Etowah
Cove; but vanity is a sensitive plant, and requires
tender nurture. He stood silent and flushing for
a moment, while still a gentle fibrous resonance
seemed to pervade the room,—the memory of the
song rather than its echo; then, with a sudden
flouting airy whirl, he turned on his heel, and
caught off the cloth that had enveloped the pail of
earth containing the persimmon seed which he had
just planted. And lo! glossy and green and lustrous
in the light, there stood a fair young shoot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
some two feet in height, and with all its leaves
a-rustle. It was a good trick and very cleverly
done.</p>

<p>The little building once more was a babel of
sounds. The flying squirrel scrambled back to
the king-post, pausing once to look down in half-frightened
amazement. The window-panes reflected
a kaleidoscope of bright bits of color swiftly
swaying, for the audience was in a turmoil. It
was not, however, the artistic excellence of the
feat which swayed the spectators, but its agricultural
significance. This, the old farmers realized,
was indeed necromancy. Their struggles with the
tough and reluctant earth, which so grudgingly
responds to toil, oft with such hard-exacted usury,
taking so much more than it gives, and which only
the poet or the weed-loving botanist calls generous
and fruitful, had served to teach them that this
kind of growth must needs come only through the
wiles of the deluding devil. Not even an agricultural
paper—had they known of such a sophistication—could
countenance such deceits. A grim,
ashen-tinted face with gray hair appeared near the
back of the building; a light gray homespun coat
accentuated its pallor. A long finger was warningly
shaken at the juggler, as he stood, triumphant,
flushed, beside the flourishing shoot he had
evoked from the persimmon seed, but only half
smiling, for something sinister in the commingled
voices had again smitten his attention. Then he
was arraigned by Parson Greenought with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
solemn adjuration in a loud tone, “Pause, Mr.
Showman, pause!”</p>

<p>The juggler was already petrified. The spectators
obeyed the earnest command, albeit not intended
for them. They fell once more into their
places; the heads of many turned now toward the
juggler, and again back to the preacher, who, in
his simplicity, had no idea that he had transgressed
the canons of sanctification in visiting a place of
worldly amusement, since indeed this was his first
opportunity, and greatly had he profited by it,
until this last enormity had aroused his clerical
conscience. “Mr. Showman,” he demanded, “do
you-uns call this religion?”</p>

<p>“Religion!” said Mr. Showman, with a burst
of unregenerate laughter, for the limits of his patience
had been nearly reached. “I call it fun.”</p>

<p>“I call it the devices of the devil!” thundered
the preacher. “An’ hyar ye be,”—he turned on
the audience,—“ye perfessin’ members, a-aggin’
this man on in his conjurin’ an’ witchments an’
Satan tricks, till fust thing ye know the Enemy
will appear, horns, hoofs, an’ tail, a-spittin’ fire
an’”—the juggler had a passing recollection that
he too could spit fire, and had intended to make
his <i>congé</i> amongst pyrotechnics of this sort, and
he welcomed the thought of caution that was not,
like most of its kind, <i>ex post facto</i>,—“a-spittin’
fire, an’ a-takin’ yer souls down ter hell with him.
Hyar ye be”—</p>

<p>“If you will allow me to interrupt you, sir,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the juggler said persuasively, “you are altogether
mistaken, and I should like to make a full explanation
to a man of your age and experience.” His
eyes were grave; his face had grown a trifle pale.
The danger had come very near. Rough handling
might well be encountered amongst these primitive
wights, inflamed by pulpit oratory and religious
excitement, and abetted by their pastoral guide.
“In two minutes,” he went on, “I can teach you
to perform this simple feat which seems to you
impossible to human agency. It is nothing but
sleight of hand, a sort of knack.”</p>

<p>For one moment Parson Greenought hesitated,
beguiled. His eye kindled with curiosity and
eagerness; he made as though he would leave the
bench whereon he was ensconced, to approach the
alluring juggler. Unfortunately, it was at the moment
that the young man’s hands, grasping the
persimmon shoot near the base, drew it forth from
the earth with a wrench, so firmly was it planted,
and showed to the discerning bucolic gaze the fully
developed root with the earth adhering to its fibres;
thus proving by the eyesight of the audience, beyond
all power of gainsaying, that it had sprouted
from the seed and grown two feet high while this
juggler—this limb of Satan—had sung his little
song about his Pretty Jane.</p>

<p>A man rarely has to contend with an excess
of faith in him and his deeds. The juggler was
fiercely advised by a dark-browed man leaning
forward across one of the benches, with a menacing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
duplication of his figure and the gesture of his
clenched fist reflected in the window, not to try to
slip out of it.</p>

<p>And Parson Greenought, with a swelling redundancy
of voice and a great access of virtue, gave
forth expression of his desire to abide by the will
that had ordained the growth of every herb whose
seed is in itself upon the earth; he would not
meddle and he would not mar, nor would he learn
with unhallowed and wicked curiosity thus to pervert
the laws that had been laid down while the
earth was yet void and without form.</p>

<p>“Well, it never yet was ordained that this persimmon
seed was to grow,” said the juggler, still
game, though with a fluctuating color. He fished
the stone out from the earth, and, dusting it off
with his fine white handkerchief, put it between
his strong molar teeth and cracked it. He would
not again invite attention to the reluctance of the
audience to approach him, so he laid it down on
the edge of the front bench with the remark,
“You can see for yourselves the kernel is withered;
that thing has no capacities for growth.”</p>

<p>One or two looked cautiously at the withered
kernel within the riven pit, and then glanced significantly
at each other. It was shrunken, old,
worthless, as he had said, but then his black art
was doubtless sufficient to have withered it with
the mere wish.</p>

<p>“I don’t know a persimmon sprout from a dogwood,
or a sumach, or anything else,” declared the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
juggler. His face was hard and dogged; he was
compelled in his own behoof to unmask himself
and show how very superficial were his cleverest
efforts. He did it as ungraciously as he might.
“This young man”—he indicated a bold bluff
young mountaineer who was availing himself of
the “standing-room only,” to which a number of
the youths were relegated—“dug up this sprout
at my request this afternoon, and hunted out a
last year’s seed among the dead leaves on the
ground.”</p>

<p>As his eyes met those of this young fellow the
twinkle of mischievous delight in the mountaineer’s
big blue orbs gave him a faint zest of returning
relish for the situation, albeit the primitive denizens
of the Cove had been all too well humbugged even
for his own comfort.</p>

<p>“This pocket is torn,”—he thrust his hand into
it,—“and has no bottom. I therefore slipped
this wand into this pocket of these knickerbockers,”
suiting the action to the word. “You see
the leaves all fold together, so that its presence
does not even mar the pronounced symmetry of
my garments. Then I placed the seed, thus, and
threw the cloth over the pail, thus; with my left
hand I slipped out the persimmon shoot, and
planted it, thus; and it was beneath the cloth that
I left in a peak to give it air and to conceal it
while I had the honor to entertain you by singing.”</p>

<p>He supposed that he would have satisfied even
the most timorous and doubtful by this revelation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
of his methods and of the innocuous nature of his
craft, but he could not fail to note the significantly
shaken heads, the disaffected whispers, the colloguing
of the young mountaineers occupying “standing-room
only.”</p>

<p>“Ef he hed done it that-a-way at fust, I’d hev
viewed it sure. I viewed it plain this time,” said
one of these.</p>

<p>“He can’t fool me,” protested a sour-visaged
woman who kept up a keen espionage on all the
world within the range of her pink sunbonnet.</p>

<p>“One lie never mended another,” said the old
preacher aside in a low voice to a presiding elder.
“Potsherds, lies are, my brother; they hold no
water.”</p>

<p>The juggler could deceive them easily enough,
but alack, he could not undeceive them! He debated
within himself the possibility which each of
his feats possessed of exciting their ire, as he hurriedly
rummaged in the drawer of the table. He
closed it abruptly.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said, “behold this
paper of needles; and here also I desire to introduce
to your notice this small spool of thread—Has
any lady here,” he continued, with the air of
breaking off with a sudden thought, “any breadths
of calico or other fabric which she might desire to
have run up or galloped up? I am a great seamster.”</p>

<p>Of course, although some had brought their
babies, and one or two their lunch to stop the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
mouths of the older children, many their snuff or
their tobacco, no one had brought work on this
memorable outing to the show in the Cove.</p>

<p>“What a pity!” he cried. “Well, I can only
show you how I thread needles. I swallow them
all, thus,” and down they went. “Then I swallow
the thread,” and forthwith the spool disappeared
down his throat.</p>

<p>The audience, educated by this time to expect
marvels, sat staring, stony and still. There was
a longer interval than usual as he stood with one
hand on the table, half smiling, half expectant,
as if he too were doubtful of the result. Suddenly
he lifted his hand, and began to draw one
end of the thread from his lips. On it came,
longer and longer; and here and there, threaded
and swaying on the fine filament, were the needles,
of assorted sizes, beginning with the delicate and
small implement, increasing grade by grade, till
the descending scale commenced, and the needles
dwindled as they appeared.</p>

<p>Parson Greenought had risen when the thread
was swallowed, but he lingered till the last cambric
needle was laid on the table, and the prestidigitator
had made his low bow of self-flattery and
triumph in conclusion. Then having witnessed it
all, his forefinger shaking in the air, he cried out:
“I leave this place! I pernounce these acts ter be
traffickin’ with the devil an’ sech. Ef I be wrong,
the Lord will jedge me ’cordin’; ez he hev gin
me gifts I see with my eyes, an’ my eyes air true,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
an’ they war in wisdom made, an’ war made ter
see with. Oh, young man, pause in time! Sin
hev marked ye! Temptation beguiles ye! I
dunno what ye hev in mind, but beware of it!
Beware of the sin that changes its face, an’ shifts
its name, an’ juggles with the thing ez is not what
it seems ter be. Beware! beware!”</p>

<p>As he stalked out, the juggler sought to laugh,
but he winced visibly. The spectators were on
their feet now, having risen with the excitement
of the moment of the old man’s exit. There was,
however, a manifest disposition to linger; for having
become somewhat acclimated to miracles, their
appetite for the wonder-working was whetted.
But the juggler, frowning heavily, had turned
around, and was shaking the cloth out, and banging
about in the drawer of the table, as if making
his preparations for departure. The people began
to move slowly to the door. It was not his
intention to dismiss the audience thus summarily
and unceremoniously, and as the situation struck
his attention he advanced toward the front of the
platform.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he began; but his
voice was lost in the clatter of heavy boots on the
floor, the scraping of benches moved from their
proper places to liberate groups in order to precede
their turn in the procession, the sudden sleepy protest
of a half-awakened infant, rising in a sharp
crescendo and climaxing in a hearty bawl of unbridled
rage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“Ladies and gentlemen!” he cried vainly to
the dusty atmosphere, and the haggard, disheveled
aspect of the half-deserted room. “Oh, go along,
then,” he added, dropping his voice, “and the
devil take you!”</p>

<p>His mountain acquaintance had come to the side
of the platform, and stood waiting, one hand on the
table, while he idly eyed the juggler, who had
returned to rummaging the drawer. He was a
tall strong young fellow, with straight black hair
that grew on his forehead in the manner denominated
a “cowlick,” and large contemplative blue
eyes; his face showed some humor, for the lines
broke readily into laughter. His long boots were
drawn high over his brown jeans trousers, and his
blue-checked homespun shirt was open at the neck,
and showed his strong throat that held his head
very sturdily and straight.</p>

<p>He was compassionate at the moment. “Plumb
beat out, ain’t ye?” he said sympathetically.</p>

<p>“I’m half dead!” cried the juggler furiously,
throwing off his blazer, and wiping his hot face
with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>The open door admitted the currents of the chill
night air and the pungent odors of the dense dark
woods without. Calls to the oxen in the process
of gearing up sounded now and again droningly.
Occasionally quick hoofbeats told of a horseman’s
departure at full gallop. The talk of waiting
groups outside now came mingled to the ear, then
ceased and rose anew. More than once a loud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
yawn told of the physical stress of the late hour
and the unwonted excitement. The young mountaineer
was going the rounds of the room extinguishing
the tallow dips laboriously; taking each
down, blowing gustily at it, and replacing it in
the sconce. The juggler, as he passed, with his
blazer over his arm, quenched the lights far more
expeditiously, but mechanically, as it seemed, by
fanning the timorous flames out <i>seriatim</i> with his
hat in quick, decisive gestures. When he stood
in the door, the room dark behind him, there was
no life, no motion, in the umbrageous obscurity
at hand; naught gave token of the audience so
lately assembled save the creak of an unoiled axle
far away, and once the raucous cry of a man to
his team. Then all was still. In the hush, a
vague drowsy note came suddenly from a bird high
amongst the budding leaves of a tulip-tree hard
by. An interval, and a like dreamy response
sounded from far down the slope where pendulous
boughs overhung the river. Some sweet chord of
sympathy had brought the thought of the one to
the other in the deep dark night,—these beings so
insignificant in the plan of creation,—and one
must needs rouse itself with that veiled reedy
query, and the other, downily dreaming, must pipe
out a reassuring “All’s well.”</p>

<p>The suggestiveness of this lyric of two tones
was not lost on the juggler. He was pierced by
the poignancy of exile. He could hardly realize
that he was of the same species as the beings who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
had formed the “cultivated and intellectual audience”
he had had the honor to entertain. Not
one process of his mind could be divined by them;
not one throb of their superstitious terrors could
he share.</p>

<p>“The cursed fatality,” he growled between his
teeth, “that brought me to this God-forsaken
country!”</p>

<p>“Waal,” drawled the young mountaineer, whom
he had forgotten for the moment, “they won’t be
so tur’ble easy skeered nex’ time.”</p>

<p>“They won’t have another chance in a hurry,”
retorted the juggler angrily, as they walked away
together in single file.</p>

<p>The night was very dark, although the great
whorls of constellations were splendidly abloom in
the clear sky. If a raylet fell to earth in the
forest, it was not appreciable in the sombre depths,
and the juggler, with all his craft, might hardly
have made shift to follow his companion but for
the spark and the light luminous smoke of the
mountaineer’s pipe. Suddenly, as they turned a
sharp edge of a series of great rocks, that like
flying buttresses projected out from the steep perpendicular
wall of a crag above them, all at once
growing visible, a white flare shone before their
eyes, illumining all the surrounding woods. There
in an open space near the edge of a bluff was
a great fire of logs burning like a funeral pyre.
The juggler had paused as if spellbound. From
the opposite side of the glowing mass a face, distorted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
tremulous, impossibly hideous, elongated
almost out of the proportion of humanity, peered
at him.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, what’s that?” he cried out,
clutching at his guide’s arm.</p>

<p>The slow mountaineer, surprised out of his composure,
paused, and took his pipe from his mouth
to stare uncomprehendingly at his companion.</p>

<p>“Jes’ burnin’ lime,” he said.</p>

<p>Their shadows, suddenly evolved, stretched over
the ground in the white flare. The Cove, not far
beneath, for this was on a low spur of the great
range, now flickered into full view, now receded
into the darkness. Above the vague mountain
the stars seemed all gone, and the sky was elusive
and cloaked. For all the art of the juggler, he
could show naught of magic more unnatural, more
ghastly, than the face of the lime-burner as it appeared
through the medium of the heated air arising
from the primitive kiln,—protean, distorted
by every current of the night’s breath,—although
it was of much significance to him, and later he
came to know it well to his cost. As the man
caught the sound of their approach, he walked
around to the side of the kiln, and his face and
figure, no longer seen through the unequally refracting
medium of the heated air, dwindled to
normal proportions. It was not a prepossessing
face in its best estate,—long, thin-lipped, grim,
with small eyes set close together, and surmounted
by a wide wool hat, which, being large for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
head, was so crushed together that its crown rose
up in a peak. His clothes were plentifully dusted
with powdery flakes, and the scalding breath of
the unslaked lime was perceptible to the throats
of the newcomers.</p>

<p>“Ye ’pear ter be powerful late,” the young
mountaineer hazarded.</p>

<p>“Weather-signs air p’intin’ fur rain,” replied
the lime-burner. “I ain’t wantin’ all this lime
ter git slacked by accident.” He glanced down
with a workman’s satisfaction at the primitive
process. Between the logs of the great pile layers
of the broken limestone were interposed, and were
gradually calcined as the fire blazed. Although
some of it was imperfectly consumed, and here
and there lay in half-crude lumps, the quantity
well burned was sufficient to warrant the laborer’s
anxiety to get it under shelter before it should
sustain the deteriorating effects of moisture.</p>

<p>“Gideon Beck war a-promisin’ ter kem back
straight arter supper,” said Peter Knowles, “an’
holp me git it inter the rock-house thar.” He indicated
a grotto in the face of the cliff, where, by
the light of the fire, one might perceive that lime
had already been stored. The beetling rocks
above it afforded adequate protection from falling
weather, and the small quantity of the commodity
was evidently disproportionate to the ample spaces
for its accommodation within. “I felt plumb
beset an’ oneasy ’bout Gid,” added Knowles.
“He mought hev hed a fit, or suthin’ may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
happened down ter his house, ter some o’ the
chil’n o’ suthin’. He merried my sister Judy, ye
know. They don’t take haffen keer o’ them
chil’n; some o’ them mought hev got sot afire o’
suthin’, or”—</p>

<p>“They <i>mought</i>, but they ain’t,” exclaimed Jack
Ormsby, the young mountaineer, with a laugh.
“Gid’s been down yander ter the show, an’ all the
chil’n, an’ yer sister Judy too.”</p>

<p>“What show?” demanded Knowles shortly, his
grim face half angry, half amazed.</p>

<p>“The show in the schoolhouse in the Cove.
This hyar stranger-man, he gin a show,” Ormsby
explained. “I viewed ’em all thar, all the fambly.”</p>

<p>There was a momentary pause, and one might
hear the wind astir in the darkness of the woods
below, and feel the dank breath of the clouds that
invisibly were gathering on the brink of the range
above. One of the sudden mountain rains was at
hand.</p>

<p>“An’ I wish I hed every one of ’em hyar
now!” exclaimed Peter Knowles in fury. “I’d
kiver ’em all up in that thar quicklime,—that’s
what I’d do! An’ thar wouldn’t be hide, hawns,
or taller lef’ of none of ’em in the mornin’.
Leave <i>me</i> hyar,—leave <i>me</i> hyar with all this
medjure o’ lime, an’ I never see none so stubborn
in burnin’, the timber bein’ so durned green an’
sappy, the dad-burned critter promisin’ an’ promisin’
ter kem back arter he got his supper,—an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
go ter a show, a damned show! What sort’n
show war it?”</p>

<p>The juggler burst out laughing. “Come ahead!”
he cried to Ormsby. “Lend a hand here!”</p>

<p>He had a strong sense of commercial values.
To let a marketable commodity lie out and be
ruined by the rain was repellent to all his convictions
of economics. It might have been as much
for the sake of the lime itself as from a sort of
half-pity for the deserted lime-burner—for Peter
Knowles had not the cast of countenance or of
soul that preëmpted a fellow feeling—that he
caught up a great shovel that lay at hand.</p>

<p>“I’ll undertake to learn the ropes in a trice,”
he declared, throwing his coat on the ground.</p>

<p>Knowles only stared at him in surly amazement,
but Ormsby, who had often seen the process, threw
aside the half-burnt-out logs and followed the lead
of the juggler, who, tense, light, active, the white
flare, terrible so close at hand, on his face and
figure, began to shovel the lumps into the barrow
or cart made to receive the lime. Then, as the
wind swept by with a warning note, Knowles too
fell to work, and added the capacities of his experience
to the sheer uninstructed force of the willing
volunteers. They made it short work. The
two neophytes found it a scorching experiment,
and more than once they fell back, flinching from
the inherent heat of the flying powder as they
shoveled it into the mouth of the grotto.</p>

<p>“I had no idea,” the juggler said, as he stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
by the embers when it was all over, looking from
one smarting hand to the other, “that quicklime
is so very powerful, so caustic an agent. I can
believe you when you say that if you should put a
body in that bed there it would be consumed by
morning,—bones and all?” He became suddenly
interrogative.</p>

<p>“Nare toe nor toe-nail lef’,” returned Peter
Knowles succinctly, as if he had often performed
this feat as a scientific experiment.</p>

<p>The juggler lifted his eyes to the face of the
man opposite. They dilated and lingered fascinated
with a sort of horror; for that strange anamorphosis
had once more possessed it. All at
variance it was with its natural contours, as the
heated air streamed up from the bed of half-calcined
stone,—trembling through this shimmering
medium, yet preserving the semblance of humanity,
like the face of some mythical being, demon
or ghoul. A dawning significance was on his own
face, of which he was unconscious, but which the
other noted. How might he utilize this property
of air and heat and quicklime in some of those
wonders of jugglery at which he was so expert?
More than once, as he walked away, he turned back
to gaze anew at the phenomenon, his trim figure
lightly poised, his hand in his belt, his blazer
thrown over his arm, that gleam of discovery on
his face.</p>

<p>As the encompassing rocks and foliage at last
hid him from view, Peter Knowles looked down
into the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“That air a true word. The quicklime would
eat every bone,” he said slowly. “But what air
<i>he</i> aimin’ ter know fur?” And once more he
looked curiously at the spot where the juggler had
vanished, remembering the guise of discovery and
elation his face had worn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Late</span> that night old Tubal Sims lingered on his
hearthstone, brooding over the embers of the failing
fire. As he reviewed the incidents of the evening,
he chuckled with a sort of half-suppressed glee.
His capacities for enjoyment were not blunted
by the event itself; the very reminiscence afforded
him a keen and acute pleasure. In all his sixty
years he had never known such a vigil as this.
He could not sleep for the crowding images with
which his brain teemed. Each detail as it was
enacted returned to him now with a freshened
delight. The objections urged by the audience on
the score of necromancy gave him peculiar joy;
for he and his wife were of a progressive tendency
of mind, and had that sly sense of mental superiority
which is one of the pleasantest secrets to
share with one’s own consciousness. As he sat on
a broken-backed chair, his shoulders bent forward
and his hands hanging loosely over his knees, the
hard palms rubbing themselves together from time
to time, for the air was growing chilly, the light
of the embers on his shock of grizzled hair, and
wrinkled face with its long blunt nose and projecting
chin, and small deep-set eyes twinkling under
their overhanging brows, he now and again lifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
his head to note any sudden stir about the house.
So foreign to his habit was this long-lingering
wakefulness that it told on his nerves in an added
acuteness of all his senses. He marked the gnawing
of a mouse in the roof-room, the sound of the
rising wind far away, and the first stir of the elm-tree
above the clapboards. A cock crew from his
roost hard by, and then with a yawn Tubal Sims
pulled off one of his shoes and sat with it in his
hand, looking at it absently, and laughing at the
thought of old Parson Greenought and his interference
to discourage Satan. “I wisht I could
hev knowed what the boy would hev done nex’,
if so be he hed been lef’ alone.” He made up his
mind that he would ask the juggler the next day,
and if possible induce a private repetition of some
of the wonders for the appreciation of which, evidently,
the public sentiment of Etowah Cove was
not yet ripe. For the juggler was his guest, having
reached his house a few evenings previous
in the midst of a storm; and asking for shelter
for the night, the wayfarer had found a hearty
welcome, and was profiting by it. Sims could
hear even now the bed-cords creak as he tossed
in uneasy slumber up in the roof-room, so still the
house had grown.</p>

<p>So still that when a deep groan and then an
agonized gasping sigh came from the sleeper, the
sounds were so incongruous with the trend of old
Tubal Sims’s happy reflections that he experienced
a sudden revulsion of feeling that was like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
shock. The rain began to fall on the roof; it
seemed to come in fine lines on a fluctuating gust,
for it was as if borne away on the wings of the
wind, and the eaves vaguely dripped.</p>

<p>“But oh,” cried the sleeper, “the one who lives!
what can I do!—for whose life! his life! his
life!” and spoke no more.</p>

<p>Yet the cabalistic words seemed to ring through
the house in trumpet tones; they sounded again
and again in every blast of the wind. The place
had grown cold; the fire was dead on the hearth;
it was the unfamiliar midnight. Old Tubal Sims
sat as motionless as if petrified. He had never
heard of the process of mind-reading, but he would
fain decipher these sleeping thoughts of his guest.
He found himself involved in tortuous and futile
speculations. Who was “the one who lives,”
whose life this stranger grudged? And following
the antithesis,—not that Tubal Sims would have
thus phrased it,—was there then one who died?
And why should the recollection return in the deep
slumbers of the night and speak out in this weird
dreaming voice.</p>

<p>It occurred to Tubal Sims, for the first time,
that there was something inexplicable about this
man. Apparently, he had no mission here save
for the exhibition of jugglery,—how suddenly it
had lost its zest! He knew naught of the people
or the surrounding region; he had no baggage, no
sort of preparation for continued existence, not
even a change of clothes. Mrs. Sims, being subsidized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
to supply this deficiency, had already constructed
for him one blue homespun shirt, which
evidently astounded him when he first beheld it,
so different it was from the one he wore, but
which he accepted meekly enough. Tubal Sims
told himself that he had been precipitate in housing
this stranger beyond a shelter during the
storm.</p>

<p>To this it had come,—the happy dreaming over
the fire, renewing a pleasure so rare,—to these
vague fears and self-reproaches and suspicions and
anxious speculations. He stumbled to bed at last
in the dark, yet still the words and the tone
haunted him. It was long ere he slept, and more
than once he was roused from slumber to the dark
silence by the fancy that he heard anew the poignant
iteration.</p>

<p>If the juggler had dreams, they may have
weighed heavily upon him the next day, for he
came down the rickety stairs, pale and silent, with
heavy-lidded eyes and dark blue circles beneath
them. Under Mrs. Sims’s kindly ministrations
he sought in vain to eat the heavy thick biscuit,
the underdone fried mush, and the fat greasy
bacon; for Mrs. Sims was not one of those culinary
geniuses sometimes encountered at humble
boards; in good sooth, but for her cows and chickens,
in these early days of his stay in Etowah
Cove, he would have fared ill indeed.</p>

<p>“Ye make a better out at swallerin’ needles ’n
ye do swallerin’ fried ’taters,” she declared, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
a reproachful glance, supplemented by her good-humored
chuckle.</p>

<p>He could make no sort of compact with the beverage
she called coffee, and after the merest feint
of breakfast he took his host’s angling-tackle and
wended his way down to the river, observing that
the fish would bite well to-day, since it was so
cloudy. Cloudy it was, undoubtedly, sombre and
drear. Now and then drizzling showers fell, and
when they ceased the mists that rose in the ravines
and skulked in every depression were hardly less
dank and chill. The river, in its deep channel
between jagged rocky gray bluffs and shelving red
clay banks of the most brilliant terra-cotta tones,
was of the color of copper instead of the clear
steel-gray or the silvered blue it was wont to show,
so much of the mud of its borders did it hold now
in solution, brought down by the rains of the night.
Here and there slender willows hung over it in
lissome and graceful wont, with such vivid vernal
suggestions in the tender budding foliage as to
cause the faint green tint to shine with definite lustre,
like the high lights in some artificial landscape
of a canvas, amidst the dark dripping bronze-green
pines of the Cove, which from this point the young
man could see stretching away in sad-hued verdure
some three or four miles to the opposite mountain’s
base,—the breadth of the restricted little basin.
This was the only large outlook at his command;
for behind the house he had quitted, the slopes of
the wooded mountain rose abruptly, steep, rugged,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
soon lost among the clouds. He gazed absently
at the little cabin, the usual structure of two rooms
with an open passage, as he lay on the shelving
rock high above the river, the fishing-pole held by
a heavy boulder fixed on it to secure it in its place,
his hands clasped under his head, his hat tilted
somewhat over his eyes; for despite the paucity of
light in the atmosphere the mists had a certain
white glaring quality.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he was the subject of a degree of
disaffected scrutiny from indoors.</p>

<p>“Jane Ann,” said Tubal Sims, suddenly interrupting
the loud throaty wheeze by which his help-meet
beguiled the tedium of washing the dishes,
and which she construed as that act of devotion
commonly known as singing a hymn, “that thar
man ain’t got no bait on his hook.”</p>

<p>Jane Ann set the plate in her hand down on the
table, and turned her broad creased face toward
her husband as he sat smoking in the passage, just
outside the door.</p>

<p>“Then he ain’t goin’ ter ketch no feesh,” she
replied logically, and lifting both the plate and
her droning wheeze she resumed her occupation.</p>

<p>Tubal Sims, like other men, fluctuated in his
estimation of his wife’s abilities according as they
seemed to him convertible to his aid. Ordinarily,
he was wont to commend Jane Ann Sims’s
logical common sense as “powerful smartness,”
and had been known to lean on her judgment
even in the matter of “craps,” in which, if anywhere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
man is safe from the interference and even
the ambition of woman. He rejoiced in her freedom
from the various notions which appertain to
her sex, and felt a certain pride that she too had
withstood the panic which had so preyed upon the
pleasures of the “show.” But now, when her
lack of the subtler receptivities balked him of a
possible approach to the key of the mystery which
he sought to solve, he was irritated because of her
density of perception, and disposed to underrate
her capacities to deduce aught from that cabalistic
phrase which he alone had heard uttered in the
deep midnight and from such slender premises
to frame a just conclusion. And furthermore,
with the rebuff he realized anew that Jane Ann
Sims was a woman, incompetent of reason save in
its most superficial processes, or she would have perceived
that the significance of the unbaited hook lay
in the strange mental perturbation which could involve
the neglect of so essential a particular, not
in the obvious fruitlessness of the labor. Jane
Ann Sims was a woman. Let her wash the dishes.</p>

<p>“Naw,” he said aloud, half scornfully, “he’ll
ketch no feesh.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sims ceased to wheeze, and her fat face
relapsed from the pious distortions of her psalmody
into its normal creases and dimples. “I be plumb
fit ter fly inter the face o’ Providence,” she said,
as she moved heavily about the table and slapped
down a blue platter but half dried.</p>

<p>“What fur?” demanded the lord of the house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
whose sense of humor was too blunted by his
speculations, and a haunting anxiety, and a troublous
eagerness to discuss the question of his discovery,
to perceive aught of the ludicrous in the
lightsome metaphor with which his weighty spouse
had characterized her disaffection with the ordering
of events.</p>

<p>“Kase Euphemy ain’t hyar, o’ course. Ye
’pear ter be sorter dunder-headed this mornin’!”
Thus the weaker vessel!</p>

<p>She wheezed one more line of her matutinal
hymn in a dolorous cadence and with breathy interstices
between the spondees; then suddenly and
finally discarding the exercise, she began to speak
with animation: “I hev always claimed an’ sot
out ter be suthin’ of a prophet,—ye yerse’f know
ez I be more weatherwise ’n common. I be toler’ble
skilled in cow diseases, too; an’ I kin say
’forehand who be goin’ ter git ’lected ter office,—ginerally,
though, by knowin’ who hev got money
an’ holds his hand slack; an’ I kin tell what color
hair a baby be goin’ ter hev whenst he ain’t got
so much ez a furze on the top o’ his bald pate; an’
whenst ye ’low ye air strict sober of a Christmastime
or sech, I kin tell ter a—a quart how much
applejack hev gone down yer gullet; an’”—</p>

<p>He sacrificed his curiosity as to her other accomplishments
as a seer, and hastily inquired, “What
on the yearth hev sot ye off ter braggin’ this-a-way,
Jane Ann? I never hearn the beat!”</p>

<p>“I ain’t braggin’,” expounded Mrs. Sims. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
be just meditatin’ on how forehanded I be in
viewin’ facts in gineral; an’ yit,”—her voice rose
in pathetic exasperation,—“the very day o’ the
evenin’ this hyar stranger-man got hyar I let
Euphemy go over ter Piomingo Cove ter visit her
granny’s folks; an’ the chile didn’t want ter go
much,—war afeard o’ rain, bein’ dressed out
powerful starched; an’ I, so forehanded in sight,
told her ’twarn’t goin’ ter rain till evenin’.”</p>

<p>“Waal, no more did it. Phemie war under
shelter six hours ’fore it rained.”</p>

<p>“Lawd-a-massy!” cried Mrs. Sims, at the end
of her patience. “What war the use o’ creatin’
man with sech a slow onderstandin’? I reckon
the reason woman war made arterward war ter gin
the critter somebody ter explain things ter him!
Can’t you-uns sense”—she directly addressed her
husband—“ez what I be a-tryin’ ter compass is
why—why—I could tell ter a minit when the
storm war a-comin’, an’ yit couldn’t tell the juggler
war comin’ with it?”</p>

<p>Tubal Sims, staring up from under his shaggy
eyebrows, his arms folded on his knees, his cob
pipe cocked between his teeth, could only ejaculate,
“I dunno.”</p>

<p>“Naw, you-uns dunno,” flouted Mrs. Sims,
“an’ you-uns dunno a heap besides that.”</p>

<p>He received this fling in humble silence. Then,
after the manner of the henpecked, unable to keep
out of trouble, albeit before his eyes, and flinching
at the very moment from discipline, he must needs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
inquire, “Why, Jane Ann, what you-uns want
the pore child hyar fur? Ye git on toler’ble well
with the cookin’ ’thout her help. Let Phemie
git her visit out ter her granny in Piomingo
Cove,” he concluded expostulatingly.</p>

<p>There was not a dimple in Mrs. Sims’s face.
It was all solid, set, stern, fat. She sunk down
into a chair and folded her arms as she gazed at
him. “Tubal Cain Sims,” she admonished him
solemnly, “ef I hed no mo’ head-stuffin’ ’n you-uns,
I’d git folks ter chain me up like that thar
tame b’ar at Sayre’s Mill, so ez ’twould be knowed
I warn’t ’sponsible. Ye hev yer motions like him,
an’ ye kin scratch yer head like him, too; but he
can’t talk sense, an’ ye can’t nuther.” She paused
for a moment; then she condescended to explain:
“I want that child Euphemy hyar kase she oughter
hed a chance ter view that show las’ night.”</p>

<p>His countenance changed. He too valued the
“show” as a special privilege. He was woe for
Euphemia’s sake, away down yonder in the backwoods
of Piomingo Cove.</p>

<p>“Mebbe he mought gin another show over yander
ter the Settlemint,” he hazarded. “The folks
over thar will be plumb sharp-set fur sech doin’s
whenst they hear ’bout’n it.”</p>

<p>The sophistications of polite society are not recognized
by the medical faculty as amongst the
epidemics which spread among mankind, but no
contagious principle has so dispersive a quality in
every feature of the malady. Given one show in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Etowah Cove, and Tubal Cain Sims developed the
acumen of a keen <i>impresario</i>. He saw the opportunity,
counted the chances, evolved as an original
idea—for the existence of such a scheme had
never reached his ears—a successful starring tour
around the coves and mountain settlements of the
Great Smoky range.</p>

<p>The melancholy expressed in the slow shaking
of Mrs. Sims’s head aroused him from this project.</p>

<p>“Naw,” she said; “the fool way that the folks
tuk on ’bout Satan—they’d better hev the high-strikes
’count o’ thar sins—an’ thar theatenings
an’ sech will purvent him. He won’t show agin.
An’ I be plumb afeard,” she cried out in renewed
vexation, “the man will get away from hyar ’thout
viewin’ Euphemy. I’ll be bound he hev never
seen the like of her!” with a joyous note of maternal
pride.</p>

<p>The pipe turned around in Tubal Sims’s mouth,
and the charge of fire and ashes and tobacco fell
unheeded on the floor. Like a voice in his ears
the echo of that strange cry of the sleeper came to
him out of the deep darkness of the stormy midnight,
with the problem of its occult significance,
with the terror of its possible meaning, and every
other consideration slipped from his consciousness.
The perception of the mental trouble expressed in
the man’s face, its confirmation even in the trifle
of the unbaited hook, returned to Sims, with the
determination that he must know more of him or
get him out of the Cove before Euphemia’s return.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
“The man’s dad-burned good-lookin’,” he said to
himself, perceiving the fact for the first time, since
it had a personal application. “An’ Phemie be
powerful book-l’arned, an’ be always scornin’ the
generality o’ the young cusses round about, kase
she knows more ’n they do. Mebbe he knows
more ’n she do.” He pondered for a moment on
the improbability that daughter Euphemia’s knowledge,
acquired at the little schoolhouse where the
“show” had been held, was exceeded by the fund
of information stored in the brain-pan of any single
individual since the world began. At all events,
anxiety, complications, familiar association in the
sanctions of the fireside, impended. This was a
man with a secret, and, innocent or guilty, a
stranger to his host. He must be quick, for Mrs.
Sims—transparent Mrs. Sims!—was even now
evolving methods by which Euphemia might be
summoned peremptorily from Piomingo Cove, and
canvassing means of transportation. She chuckled
even amidst her anxieties. The juggler, in all his
experience,—and his conversation now and again
gave intimations that he was a man of cities and
had seen much folk in his time,—had never
viewed aught like Euphemia, and if scheming
might avail, he should not leave Etowah Cove till
this crowning mercy was vouchsafed him.</p>

<p>Whether Tubal Sims vaunted his wife’s mental
qualities or derided them,—and his estimate
swung like a pendulum from one side to the other,
as her views coincided with his or differed from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
them,—he knew that on this topic she was immovable.
To pierce the juggler’s heart by a dart
still more mystic and subtle than aught his skill
could wield was her motive. Help must come, if
at all, from without the domestic circle. He
waited, doubtful, until after dinner, and as he
looked about for his hat, his resolution taken after
much brooding thought, he noted a change in the
weather-signs. The wind was blowing crisply
through the open passage. The mists had lifted.
The river, dully gurgling in the dreary early
morning, had begun anew its lapsing sibilant song
that seemed a concomitant of the sunshine; for
the slanting afternoon glitter was on the water
here and there, and high on the mountain side all
the various green possible to spring foliage was
elicited by the broad expanse of the golden sheen
that came down from the west. He noted, as he
took his way along the road, that the recumbent
figure once again on the ledge below was not
asleep, for the juggler lifted his hand as the rocks
above began to reflect the beams on the water in
a tremulous shimmer, and drew his hat further
over his eyes. “Ye mought hev better comp’ny
’n yer thoughts, Mr. Showman, I’m a-thinkin’,”
Tubal Sims muttered, and he mended his pace.</p>

<p>His path, much trodden, wended along about
the base of the range, and finally, by a series of
zigzag curves, began to ascend the slope. The
clouds, white, tenuous, were flying high now.
The sun had grown hot. Already the moisture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
was dried from the wayside foliage of laurel as he
came upon the projecting spur of the range where
the lime-burners worked. The logs, protected
from the rain by a ledge of the cliff, had been
piled anew with layers of limestone, and the primitive
process of calcination had begun once more.
Here and there were great heaps of fragments of
rock placed close at hand, and numerous trees had
been felled for fuel and lay at length on the
ground, yet so dense was the forest that the loss
was not appreciable to the eye. The stumps and
boles of these trees furnished seats for a number
of lounging mountaineers, in every attitude that
might express a listless sloth. Those who had
come to work felt that they had earned a respite
from labor, and those who had come to talk hastened
to utilize the opportunity. Their conversation
was something more brisk than usual, accelerated
by interest in a new and uncommon topic. As
Sims had foreseen, the events of the previous evening
occupied every thought, and several of the
group experienced a freshened joy in detailing
them anew to Peter Knowles, who alone of all the
neighborhood for a circuit of twenty miles had
been absent. He had heard every incident repeatedly
rehearsed without showing a sign of flagging
interest. Now and then he bent his brows
and looked down at the quicklime scattered on the
ground, and silently meditated on its capacity to
destroy flesh and bone and on the juggler’s unhallowed
curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“A body dunno how ter git his own cornsent
ter b’lieve his own eyesight,” one of the men reflectively
averred. The interval since witnessing
the astounding feats of the prestidigitator had afforded
space for rumination, and but served to
deepen the impression of possibilities set at naught
and miracles enacted.</p>

<p>“That thar man air in league with Satan,”
declared another, “Surely, surely he air.” He
accentuated his words with his long lean forefinger
shaken impressively at the group.</p>

<p>“Ye mark my words,” said Peter Knowles suddenly,
still eying the refuse of quicklime on the
ground, “no good hev kem inter the Cove with
that thar man.”</p>

<p>“Whar’d he kem from, ennyhows?” demanded
the first speaker.</p>

<p>“Whar’d he kem from?” repeated Knowles,
peering over the great kiln. “From hell, my
frien’,—straight from hell.”</p>

<p>He had the combined drone and whine which he
esteemed appropriate to the clerical office; for
although he had never experienced a “call,” he
deemed himself singularly fitted for that vocation
by virtue of a disposition to hold forth at great
length to any one who would listen to his views on
religious themes,—and in this region, where time
is plenty and industry scanty, he seldom lacked
listeners,—a conscience ever sensitive to the sins
of other people, and great freedom in the use of
such Scriptural terms as are debarred to persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
not naturally profane or suffering under the stress
of extreme rage.</p>

<p>“Waal, sir!” exclaimed old man Cobbs, sitting
on a stump and gently nursing his knee. He
spoke with a voice of deep reprehension, and as
simple an acceptance of the possibility of hailing
from the place in question as if it were geographically
extant.</p>

<p>Ormsby, who had been standing leaning on an
axe, silently listening, laughed slightly at this,—an
incredulous laugh. “Folks ez git ter that kentry
don’t git back in a hurry,” he drawled negligently,
but with a manifest satisfaction in the circumstance,
as if he knew of sundry departed
wights whom he esteemed well placed.</p>

<p>“How d’ye know they don’t?” demanded Peter
Knowles. “Ain’t ye never read the Scriptures
enough ter sense them lines, ‘Satan was a-walkin’
up and down through the yearth,’ ye blunderin’
buzzard, an’ <i>he</i> fell from heaven?”</p>

<p>The young fellow’s robust figure was clearly
defined against the western sky. He swung his
axe nonchalantly now, for to be an adept in reading
and remembering the Scriptures was not the
height of his ambition. Nevertheless, the idea of
the possibility of being in the orbit, as it were, of
an earthly stroll of the Prince of Darkness roused
him to argument and insistence on a less terrifying
solution of the mystery.</p>

<p>“He telled it ter me ez he kem from Happy
Valley,” he volunteered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>The elders of the party stared at one another.
The fire roared suddenly as a log broke, burned in
twain; the limestone fragments, still crude, went
rattling down into the crevices its fall had made.
Peter Knowles’s arm, with the free ministerial
gesticulation which he was wont to copy, fixed the
absurdity upon Ormsby even before he spoke.</p>

<p>“Don’t ye know that thar Philistine ain’t got
sech speech ez them ez lives in Happy Valley, nor
thar clothes, nor thar raisin’, nor thar manners,
nor thar ways, nor thar—nuthin’? Don’t you-uns
sense that?”</p>

<p>“I ’lowed ez much ter him,” replied Ormsby,
a trifle browbeaten by the seniority of his interlocutor
and the difficulty of the subject. “I up-ed
an’ said, ‘Ye ain’t nowise like folks ez live in
Happy Valley. Ter look at ye, I’d set it down
fur true ez ye hed never been in the shadder o’
Chilhowee all yer days.’”</p>

<p>“An’ what did he say, bub?” demanded old
man Cobbs gently, after a moment of waiting.</p>

<p>“Great Gosh, yes!” exclaimed Peter Knowles
explosively. “We-uns ain’t a-waitin’ hyar ter
hear you-uns tell yer talk; ennybody could hev
said that an’ mo’. What did the man say?”</p>

<p>Ormsby turned doubtfully toward the descending
sun and the reddening sky. “We-uns war
a-huntin’, me an’ that juggler. I seen him yestiddy
mornin’. I went down thar ter Mis’ Sims’
an’ happened ter view him. An’ I loant him my
brother’s gun. An’ whenst I said that ’bout his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
looks an’ sech, we war a-huntin’, an’ he ’peared not
ter know thar war enny Happy Valley ’way over
yander by Chilhowee. An’ I tuk him up high on
the mounting whar he could look over fur off an’ see
the Rich Woods an’ Happy Valley, an’—an’”—He
paused.</p>

<p>“An’ what did he say?” inquired Knowles
eagerly.</p>

<p>Ormsby looked embarrassed. “He jes’ say,”
he went on suddenly, as if with an effort, “he jes’
say, ‘Oh, Dr. Johnson!’ an’ bust out a-laffin’. I
dunno what the critter meant.”</p>

<p>Once more Ormsby turned, swinging his axe in
his strong right hand, and glanced absently over
the landscape.</p>

<p>The sun was gone. The mountains, darkly
glooming, rose high above the Cove on every side,
seeming to touch the translucent amber sky that,
despite the sunken sun, conserved an effect of illumination
heightened by contrast with the fringes
of hemlock and pine, that had assumed a sombre
purple hue, waving against its crystalline concave.
In this suffusion of reflected color, rather than in
the medium of daylight, he beheld the scanty fields
below in the funnel-like basin; for this projecting
spur near the base of the range gave an outlook
over the lower levels at hand. Some cows, he
could discern, were still wending homeward along
an undulating red clay road, which rose and fell
till the woods intervened. The woods were black.
Night was afoot there amongst the shadowy boughs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
for all the golden glow of the feigning sky. The
evening mists were adrift along the ravines. Ever
and anon the flames flickered out, red and yellow,
from the heap of logs. Not a sound stirred the
group as they pondered on this strange reply, till
Ormsby said reflectively, “The juggler be toler’ble
good comp’ny, though,—nuthin’ like the devil
an’ sech; leastwise, so much ez I know ’bout
Satan,”—he seemed to defer to the superior acquaintanceship
of Knowles. “This hyar valley-man
talks powerful pleasant; an’ he kin sing,—jes’
set up an’ sing like a plumb red-headed mock-in’bird,
that’s what! You-uns hearn him sing at
the show,”—he turned from Knowles to appeal to
the rest of the group.</p>

<p>“Did he ’pear ter you-uns, whilst huntin’, ter
try enny charms an’ spells on the wild critters?”
asked Knowles.</p>

<p>“They didn’t work ef he did!” exclaimed Jack
Ormsby, with a great gush of laughter that startled
the echoes into weird unmirthful response. “He
shot one yallerhammer arter travelin’ nigh ten
mile ter git him.” After a pause, “I gin him the
best chance at a deer I ever hed. I never see
a feller hev the ‘buck ager’ so bad. He never
witched that deer. He shot plumb two feet too
high. She jes’ went a-bouncin’ by him down the
mounting,—bouncin’ yit, I reckon! But he kin
shoot toler’ble fair at a mark.” The ready laughter
again lighted his face. “He ’lows he likes a
mark ter shoot at kase it stands still. He’s plumb
pleasant comp’ny sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“Waal, he ain’t been sech powerful pleasant
comp’ny down ter my house,” protested Tubal
Sims. “Ain’t got a word ter say, an’ ’pears like
he ain’t got the heart ter eat a mouthful o’ vittles.
Yander he hev been a-lyin’ flat on them wet rocks
all ter-day, with no mo’ keer o’ the rheumatics ’n
ef he war a bullfrog,—a-feeshin’ in the ruver
with a hook ’thout no bait on it.”</p>

<p>“What’d he ketch?” demanded one of the
men, with a quick glance of alarm. Miracles for
the purpose of exhibition and cutting a dash they
esteemed far less repellent to the moral sense than
the use of uncommon powers to serve the ordinary
purposes of daily life.</p>

<p>“Pleurisy, ef he got his deserts,” observed the
disaffected host. “He caught nuthin’ with ez
much sense ez a stickle-back. ’Pears ter me he
ain’t well, nohow. He groaned a power in his
sleep las’ night, arter the show. An’”—he felt
he ventured on dangerous ground—“he talked,
too.”</p>

<p>There was a significant silence. “That thar
man hev got suthin’ on his mind,” muttered Peter
Knowles.</p>

<p>“I be powerful troubled myself,” returned the
level-headed Sims weakly. “I oughtn’t ter hev
tuk him in,—him a stranger, though”—he remembered
the hospitable text in time for a flimsy
self-justification. “But ’twar a-stormin’ powerful,
and he ’peared plumb beat out. I ’lowed
that night he war goin’ inter some sort’n fever or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
dee-lerium. I put him inter the roof-room, an’
he went ter bed ez soon ez he could git thar. But
the nex’ day he war ez fraish an’ gay ez a jaybird.”</p>

<p>“What’s he talk ’bout whenst sleepin’?” asked
Peter Knowles, his covert glance once more reverting
to the refuse of quicklime at his feet.</p>

<p>“Suthin’ he never lays his tongue ter whenst
wakin’, I’ll be bound,” replied Tubal Sims precipitately.
Then he hesitated. This disclosure
was, he felt, a flagrant breach of hospitality.
What right had he to listen to the disjointed exclamations
of his guest in his helplessness as he
slept, place his own interpretation upon them, and
retail them to others for their still more inimical
speculation? Jane Ann Sims,—how he would
have respected her judgment had she been a man!—he
was sure, would not have given the words a
second thought. But then her habit of mind was
incredulous. Parson Greenought often told her
that he feared her faith was not sufficient to take
her to heaven. “I be dependin’ on suthin’ better’n
that, pa’son,” she would smilingly rejoin.
“I ain’t lookin’ ter my own pore mind an’ my
own wicked heart fur holp. An’ ye mark my
words, I’ll be the fust nangel ye shake han’s with
when ye git inside the golden door.” And the
parson, impaled on his own weapons, could only
suggest that they should sing a hymn together,
which they did,—Jane Ann Sims much the louder
of the two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>Admirable woman! she had but a single weakness,
and this Tubal Cain Sims was aware that he
shared. With the returning thought of their
household idol, Euphemia, every consideration imposing
reticence vanished.</p>

<p>“Last night,” he began suddenly, “I war so
conflusticated with the goin’s-on ez I couldn’t
sleep fur a while. An’ ez I sot downsteers afore
the fire, I could but take notice o’ how oneasy this
man ’peared in his sleep up in the roof-room. He
sighed an’ groaned like suthin’ in agony. An’
then he says, so painful, ‘But the one who lives—oh,
what can I do—the one who lives! fur his
life!—his life!—his life!’” He paused abruptly
to mark the petrified astonishment on the group of
faces growing white in the closing dusk.</p>

<p>An owl began to hoot in the bosky recesses far
up the slope. At the sound, carrying far in the
twilight stillness, a hound bayed from the door of
the little cabin in the Cove, by the river. A light,
stellular in the gloom that hung about the lower
levels, suddenly sprung up in the window. A
tremulous elongated reflection shimmered in the
shallows close under the bank where the juggler
had been lying. Was he there yet? Sims wondered,
quivering with the excitement of the moment.</p>

<p>His anxiety was not quelled, but a great relief
came upon him when Peter Knowles echoed his own
thought, which seemed thus the natural sequence
of the event, and not some far-fetched fantasy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“That thar man hev killed somebody, ez sure ez
ye live!” exclaimed Peter Knowles. “‘But the
one who lives!’ An’ who is the one who died?”</p>

<p>“Jes’ so, jes’ so,” interpolated Sims, reassured
to see his own mental process so definitely duplicated
in the thoughts of a man held to be of experienced
and just judgment, and much regarded in
the community.</p>

<p>“He be a-runnin’ from jestice,” resumed
Knowles. “He ain’t no juggler, ez he calls hisself.”</p>

<p>There was a general protest.</p>

<p>“Shucks, Pete, ye oughter seen him swaller a
bay’net.”</p>

<p>“An’ Mis’ Sims tole him she’d resk her shears
on it, she jes’ felt so reckless an’ plumb kerried
away. An’ he swallered them, too, an’ then tuk
’em out’n his throat, sharp ez ever.”</p>

<p>“An’ he swallered a paper o’ needles an’ a
spool o’ thread, an’ brung ’em out’n his mouth all
threaded.”</p>

<p>There was a delighted laugh rippling round the
circle.</p>

<p>“Look-a-hyar, my frien’s,” remonstrated Peter
Knowles in a solemn, sepulchral voice, “I never
viewed none o’ these doin’s, but ye air all ’bleeged
ter know ez they air on-possible, the devices o’ the
devil. An’ hyar ye be, perfessin’ Christians,
a-laffin’ at them wiles ez air laid ter delude the
onwary.”</p>

<p>There was a general effort to recover a sobriety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
of demeanor, and one of the men then observed
gravely that on the occasion when these wonders
were exhibited Parson Benias Greenought taxed
the performer with this supposition.</p>

<p>“Waal,” remarked Ormsby, “ye air ’bleeged
ter hev tuk notice, ef ye war thar las’ night, ez
old Benias never moved toe or toe-nail till arter all
the jinks war most over. He seen nigh all thar
war ter see ’fore he ’lowed how the sinners war
enj’yin’ tharse’fs, an’ called up the devil ter len’
a han’.”</p>

<p>“What the man say?” demanded Peter
Knowles.</p>

<p>“He ’peared cornsider’ble set back a-fust, an’
then he tried ter laff it off,” replied Gideon Beck.
“He ’lowed he could l’arn sech things ter folks ez
he had l’arnt ’em, too.”</p>

<p>“Now tell me one thing,” argued Peter Knowles;
“how’s a man goin’ ter l’arn a pusson ter put a
persimmon seed in a pail o’ yearth, an’ lay a cloth
over it, an’ sing some foolishness, an’ take off’n
the cloth, an’ thar’s a persimmon shoot with a
root ez long ez my han’ a-growin’ in that yearth?”</p>

<p>There were sundry gravely shaken heads.</p>

<p>“Mis’ Jernigan jes’ went plumb inter the high-strikes,
she got so skeered, an’ they hed ter take
her home in the wagon,” said Beck.</p>

<p>“Old man Jernigan hed none; the las’ time I
viewed him he war a-tryin’ ter swaller old Mis’
Jernigan’s big shears hisse’f,” retorted Ormbsy.</p>

<p>“Mis’ Jernigan ain’t never got the rights o’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
herself yit, an’ her cow hev done gone dry, too,”
observed Beck.</p>

<p>“Tell me, my brethren, what’s them words mean,—‘the
one who lives’?” insisted Peter Knowles
significantly. “Sure’s ye air born, thar’s another
verse an’ chapter ter that sayin’. Who war the
one who died?”</p>

<p>Once more awe settled down upon the little
group. The wind had sprung up. Now and
again pennons of flame flaunted out from the great
heap of logs and stones, and threw livid bars of
light athwart the landscape, which pulsated visibly
as the blaze rose and fell,—now seeming strangely
distinct and near at hand, now receding into the
darkness and distance. Mystery affiliated with
the time and place, and there was scant responsiveness
to Ormsby’s protest as he once more sought
to befriend the absent juggler.</p>

<p>“I can’t git my cornsent ter b’lieve ez thar be
enny dead one. I reckon the feller war talkin’
’bout his kemin’ powerful nigh dyin’ hisself. He
’lowed ter me ez he hed a mighty great shock jes’
afore he kem hyar,—what made him so diff’ent
a-fust.”</p>

<p>“Shocked by lightning?” demanded Peter
Knowles dubiously.</p>

<p>“I reckon so; never hearn on no other kind.”</p>

<p>“Waal, now,” said Tubal Sims, who had sought
during this discussion to urge his views on the
coterie, “I ’low that the Cove ought not ter take
up with sech jubious doin’s ez these.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“Lawsy massy!” exclaimed Beck, with the uplifted
eyebrows of derision, “las’ night you-uns
an’ Mis’ Sims too ’peared plumb kerried away,
jes’ bodaciously dee-lighted, with the juggler an’
all his pay-formances!”</p>

<p>There is naught in all our moral economy which
can suffer a change without discredit and disparagement,
barring what is known as a change of
heart. It is a clumsy and awkward mental evolution
at best, as the turncoat in politics, the apologist
for discarded friendships, the fickle-minded in
religious doctrines, know to their cost. The process
of veering is attended invariably with a poignant
mortification, as if one had warranted one’s
opinions infallible, and to endure till time shall be
no more. Tubal Cain Sims experienced all the
ignominious sensations known as “eatin’ crow,”
as he sought to qualify his satisfaction of the previous
evening, and reconcile it to his complete
change of sentiment now, without giving his true
reason. It would involve scant courtesy to the
absent Euphemia to intimate his fears lest she
admire too much the juggler, and it might excite
ridicule to suggest his certainty that the juggler
would admire her far too much. Sometimes, indeed,
he doubted if other people—that is, above
the age of twenty-five—entertained the rapturous
estimate of Euphemia, which was a subject on
which he and Jane Ann Sims never differed.</p>

<p>“I did,—I did,” he sputtered. “Me an’ Jane
Ann nare one never seen no harm in the pay-formance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
An’ Jane Ann don’t know nuthin’ contrarious
yit, kase I ain’t tole her,—she bein’ a
’oman, an’ liable ter talk free an’ let her tongue
git a-goin’; she dunno whar ter stop. A man
oughtn’t ter tell his wife sech ez he aims ter go
no furder,” he added discursively.</p>

<p>“’Thout he wants all the Cove ter be a-gabblin’
over it nex’ day,” assented a husband of three
experiments. “I know wimmin. Lawsy massy!
I know ’em now.” He shook his head lugubriously,
as if his education in feminine quirks and
wiles had gone hard with him, and he could willingly
have dispensed with a surplusage of learning.</p>

<p>“But arter I hearn them strange words,” resumed
Tubal Cain Sims,—“them strange words,
so painful an’ pitiful-spoken,—I drawed the same
idee ez Peter Knowles thar. I ’lowed the juggler
war some sort’n evil-doer agin the law,—though
he didn’t look like it ter me.”</p>

<p>“He did ter me; he featured it from the fust,”
Knowles protested, with a stern drawing down of
his forbidding face.</p>

<p>There was a momentary pause while they all
seemed to meditate on the evidence afforded by the
personal appearance of the juggler.</p>

<p>“I be afeard,” continued Sims, glancing at
Knowles, “like Pete say, he hev c’mmitted murder
an’ be fleein’ from the law. An’ I be a law-abidin’
citizen—an’—an’—he can’t stay at my
house.”</p>

<p>There was silence. No one was interested in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
the impeccability of Tubal Cain Sims’s house. It
was his castle. He was free to say who should
come and who should go. His own responsibility
was its guarantee.</p>

<p>It is a pathetic circumstance in human affairs
that the fact of how little one’s personal difficulties
and anxieties and turmoils of mind count to
one’s friends can only be definitely ascertained by
the experiment made in the thick of these troubles.</p>

<p>With a sudden return of his wonted perspicacity,
Sims said, “That thar man oughter be gin
notice ter leave. I call on ye all—ye all live
round ’bout the Cove—ter git him out’n it.”</p>

<p>There was a half-articulate grumble of protest
and surprise.</p>

<p>“It’s yer business ter make him go, ef yer
don’t want him in yer house,” said Peter Knowles,
looking loweringly at Sims.</p>

<p>“I ain’t got nuthin’ agin him,” declared Sims
excitedly, holding both empty palms upward. “I
can’t say, ‘Git out; ye talk in yer sleep, an’ ye
don’t talk ter suit me!’ <i>But</i>,” fixing the logic
upon them with weighty emphasis and a significant
pause, “you-uns all b’lieve ez he air in league
with Satan, an’ his jinks air deviltries an’ sech.
An’ so be, ye <i>ought</i> ter make him take hisself an’
his conjurin’s off from hyar ’fore he witches the
craps, or spirits away the lime, or tricks the mill,
or—He ought ter be gin hours ter cl’ar out.”</p>

<p>Peter Knowles roused himself to argument. He
had developed a vivid curiosity concerning the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
juggler. The suggestion of the devil’s agency
was a far cry to his fears,—be it remembered he
had not seen the bayonet swallowed!—and he had
phenomenal talents for contrariety, and graced the
opposition with great persistence and powers of
contradiction.</p>

<p>“Bein’ ez ye hev reason ter suspect that man o’
murder or sech, we-uns ain’t got the <i>right</i> ter give
him hours ter leave. Ye ain’t got the <i>right</i> ter
turn him out’n yer house ter escape from the off’cers
o’ the law.”</p>

<p>The crowd, always on the alert for a sensation,
pricked up their willing ears. “Naw, ye ain’t,”
more than one asseverated.</p>

<p>“’Twould jes’ be holpin’ him on his run from
jestice,” declared Beck. “Further he gits, further
the sher’ff’ll hev ter foller, an’ mo’ chance
o’ losin’ him.”</p>

<p>“They be on his track now, I reckon,” said old
Josiah Cobbs dolorously.</p>

<p>“It’s the jewty o’ we-uns in the Cove,” resumed
Peter Knowles, “ter keep a stric’ watch on him
an’ see ter it he don’t git away ’fore the sher’ff
tracks him hyar.”</p>

<p>Tubal Sims’s blood ran cold. A man sitting
daily at his table under the espionage of all the
Cove as a murderer! A man sleeping in his best
feather-bed—and the way he floundered in its unaccustomed
depths nothing but a porpoise could
emulate—till the sheriff of the county should come
to hale him out to the ignominious quarters of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
common jail! Jane Ann Sims—how his heart
sank as he thought that had he first taken counsel
of her he would not now be in a position to receive
his orders from Peter Knowles!—to be in daily
friendly association with this strange guest, to be
sitting at home now calmly stitching cuffs for a
man who might be wearing handcuffs before daylight!
Euphemia—when he thought of Euphemia
he rose precipitately from the rock on which
he was seated. In twenty-four hours Euphemia
should be in Buncombe County, North Carolina,
where his sister lived. The juggler should never
see her; for who knew what lengths Jane Ann
Sims’s vicarious love of admiration would carry
her? If the man were but on his knees, what
cared she what the Cove thought of him? And
Euphemia should never see the juggler! Tubal
Sims hurried down the darkening way, hearing
without heeding the voices of his late comrades,
all dispersing homeward by devious paths,—now
loud in the still twilight, now veiled and indistinct
in the distance. The chirring of the myriad nocturnal
insects was rising from every bush, louder,
more confident, refreshed by the recent rain, and
the frogs chanted by the riverside.</p>

<p>He had reached the lower levels at last. He
glanced up and saw the first timid palpitant star
spring forth with a glitter into the midst of the
neutral-tinted ether, and then, as if affrighted at
the vast voids of the untenanted skies, disappear
so elusively that the eye might not mark the spot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
where that white crystalline flake had trembled.
It was early yet. He strode up to his own house,
whence the yellow light glowed from the window.
He stopped suddenly, his heart sinking like lead.
There on the step of the passage sat Euphemia,
her elbow on her knee, her chin in her hand, her
eyes pensively fixed on the uncertain kindling of
that pioneer star once more blazing out the road
in the evening sky.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">III.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Euphemia</span> could hardly have said what it was
that had brought her home,—some vague yet potent
impulse, some occult, unimagined power of
divination, some subjection to her mother’s will
constraining her, or simply the intuition that there
was some opportunity for mischief unimproved.
Tubal Cain Sims shook his head dubiously as he
canvassed each theory. He ventured to ask the
views of Mrs. Sims, after he had partaken of the
supper set aside for him—for the meal was concluded
before his return—and had lighted his
pipe.</p>

<p>“What brung her home? Them stout leetle
brogans,—that’s what,” said Mrs. Sims, chuckling
between the whiffs of her own pipe.</p>

<p>“Course I know the chile walked. I reckon
she’ll hev stone-bruises a plenty arter this,—full
twelve mile. But what put it inter her head ter
kem? She ’lowed ter me she ain’t dreamed o’
nuthin’, ’ceptin’ Spot hed a new calf, which she
ain’t got. Reckon ’twar a leadin’ or a warnin’
or”—</p>

<p>“I reckon ’twar homesickness. Young gals
always pine fur home, special ef thar ain’t nuthin’
spry goin’ on in a new place.” And once more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Jane Ann Sims, in the plenitude of her triumph,
chuckled.</p>

<p>It chanced, that afternoon, that when the red
sunset was aflare over the bronze-green slopes that
encircled the Cove, and the great pine near at
hand began to sway and to sing and to cast forth
the rich benison of its aroma to the fresh rain-swept
air, the juggler roused himself, pushed back
his hat from his eyes, and gazed with listless melancholy
about him. Somehow the sweet peace
of the secluded place appealed to his world-weary
senses. The sounds,—the distant, mellow lowing
of the kine, homeward wending; the tinkle of a
sheep-bell; the rhythmic dash of the river; the
ecstatic cadenzas of a mocking-bird, so intricate,
delivered with such dashing <i>élan</i>, so marvelously
clear and sweet and high as to give an effect as of
glitter,—all were so harmoniously bucolic. He
was soothed in a measure, or dulled, as he drew
a long sigh of relief and surcease of pain, and
began to experience that facile renewal of interest
common to youth with all its recuperative faculties.
It fights a valiant fight with sorrow or trouble,
and only the years conquer it at last. For
the first time he noted among the budding willows
far down the stream a roof all aslant, which he
divined at once was the mill. He rose to his feet
with a quickening curiosity. As he released the
futile fishing-rod and wound up the line he remarked
the unbaited hook. His face changed
abruptly with the thought of his absorption and
trouble. He pitied himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>The road down which he took his way described
many a curve seeking to obviate the precipitousness
of the descent. The rocks rose high on either
side for a time, and when the scene beyond broke
upon him in its entirety it was as if a curtain were
suddenly lifted. How shadowy, how fragrant the
budding woods above the calm and lustrous water!
The mill, its walls canted askew, dark and soaked
with the rain, and its mossy roof awry, was sombre
and silent. Over the dam the water fell in an unbroken
crystal sheet so smooth and languorous that
it seemed motionless, as if under a spell. Ferns
were thick on a marshy slope opposite, where scattered
boulders lay, and one quivering blossomy
bough of a dogwood-tree leaned over its white reflection
in the water, fairer than itself, like some
fond memory embellishing the thing it images.</p>

<p>With that sudden sense of companionship in
loneliness by which a presence is felt before it is
perceived, he turned sharply back as he was about
to move away, and glanced again toward the mill.
A young girl was standing in the doorway in an
attitude of arrested poise, as if in surprise.</p>

<p>Timidity was not the juggler’s besetting sin.
He lifted his hat with a courteous bow, the like
of which had never been seen in Etowah Cove,
and thus commending himself to her attention, he
took his way toward her along the slant of the
corduroy road; for this fleeting glimpse afforded
to him a more vivid suggestion of interest than the
Cove had as yet been able to present. For the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
first time since reaching its confines it occurred to
him that it might be possible to live along awhile
yet. Nevertheless, he contrived to keep his eyes
decorously void of expression, and occupied them
for the most part in aiding his feet to find their
way among the crevices and obstacles with which
the road abounded. When he paused, he asked,
suffering his eyes to rest inquiringly on the girl,
“Beg pardon, but will you kindly inform me where
is the miller?”</p>

<p>The glimpse that had so attracted him was, he
felt, all inadequate, as he stood and gazed, privileged
by virtue of his simulated interest in the
absent miller. He could not have seen from the
distance how fair, how dainty, was her complexion,
nor the crinkles and sparkles of gold in her fine
brown hair. It waved upward from her low brow
in a heavy undulation which he would have discriminated
as “à la Pompadour,” but its contour
was compassed by wearing far backward a round
comb, the chief treasure of her possessions, the
heavy masses of hair rising smoothly toward the
front, and falling behind in long, loose ringlets
about her shoulders. She had a delicate chin with
a deep dimple,—which last reminded him unpleasantly
of Mrs. Sims, for dimples were henceforth
at a discount; a fine, thin, straight nose; two dark
silken eyebrows, each describing a perfect arc;
and surely there were never created for the beguilement
of man two such large, lustrous gray-blue
eyes, long-lashed, deep-set, as those which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
served Euphemia Sims for the comparatively unimportant
function of vision. He had hardly been
certain whether her attire was more or less grotesque
than the costume of the other mountain
women until she lifted these eyes and completed the
charm of the unique apparition. She wore a calico
bought by the yard at the store, and accounted but
a flimsy fabric by the homespun-weaving mountain
women. It was of a pale green tint, and had once
been sprinkled over with large dark green leaves.
Lye soap and water had done their merciful work.
The strong crude color of the leaves had been subdued
to a tint but little deeper than the ground of
the material, and while the contour of the foliage
was retained, it was mottled into a semblance
of light and shade here and there where the dye
strove to hold fast. The figure which it draped
was pliant and slender; the feet which the full
skirt permitted to be half visible were small, and
arrayed in brown hose and the stout little brogans
which had brought her so nimbly from Piomingo
Cove. Partly amused, partly contemptuous, partly
admiring, the juggler remarked her hesitation and
embarrassment, and relished it as of his own inspiring.</p>

<p>“Waal,” she drawled at last, “I don’t rightly
know.” She gazed at him doubtfully. “Air ye
wantin’ ter see him special?”</p>

<p>He had a momentary terror lest she should ask
him for his grist and unmask his subterfuge. He
sought refuge in candor. “Well, I was admiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
the mill. This is a pretty spot, and I wished to
ask the miller’s name.”</p>

<p>There was a flash of laughter in her eyes, although
her lips were grave. “His name be Tubal
Sims; an’ ef he don’t prop up his old mill somehows,
it’ll careen down on him some day.” She
added, with asperity, “I dunno what ye be admirin’
it fur, ’thout it air ter view what a s’prisin’
pitch laziness kin kem ter.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I admire. I’m a proficient, a
professor of the science of laziness.”</p>

<p>She lifted her long black lashes only a little as
she gazed at him with half-lowered lids. “Ye
won’t find no pu<i>pils</i> in that science hyar about.
The Cove’s done graduated.” She smiled slightly,
as if to herself. The imagery of her response,
drawn from her slender experience at the schoolhouse,
pleased her for the moment, but she had no
disposition toward further conversational triumphs.
There ensued a short silence, and then she looked
at him in obvious surprise that he did not take
himself off. It would seem that he had got what
he had come for,—the miller’s name and the
opportunity to admire the mill. He experienced
in his turn a momentary embarrassment. He was
so conscious of the superiority of his social status,
knowledge of the world, and general attainments
that her apparent lack of comprehension of his
condescension in lingering to admire also the
miller’s daughter was subversive in some sort of
his wonted aplomb. It rallied promptly, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
and he went on with a certain half-veiled mocking
courtesy, of which the satire of the sentiment was
only vaguely felt through the impervious words.</p>

<p>“I presume you are the miller’s daughter?”</p>

<p>She looked at him in silent acquiescence.</p>

<p>“Then I am happy to make an acquaintance
which kind fortune has been holding in store for
me, for my stay in the Cove is at the miller’s hospitable
home.” He concluded with a smiling
flourish. But her bewitching eyes gazed seriously
at him.</p>

<p>“What be yer name?” she demanded succinctly.</p>

<p>“Leonard,—John Leonard,—very much at
your service,” he replied, with an air half banter,
half propitiation.</p>

<p>“Ye be the juggler that mam’s been talkin’
’bout,” she said as if to herself, completing his
identification. “I drawed the idee from what
mam said ez ye war a old pusson—at least cornsider’ble
on in years.”</p>

<p>“And so I am!” he cried, with a sudden change
of tone. “If life is measured by what we feel and
what we suffer, I am old,”—he paused with a
sense of self-betrayal,—“some four or five hundred
at least,” he added, relapsing into his wonted
light tone.</p>

<p>She shook her head sagely. “’Pears like ter
me ez it mought be medjured by the sense folks
gather ez they go. I hev knowed some mighty
young fools at sixty.”</p>

<p>The color showed in his face; her unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
intimation of his youth according to this method
of estimate touched his vanity, even evoked a
slight resentment.</p>

<p>“You are an ancient dame, on that theory! I
bow to your wisdom, madam,—quite the soberest
party I have seen since I entered the paradisaical
seclusion of Etowah Cove.”</p>

<p>She appreciated the belligerent note in his voice,
although she scarcely apprehended the <i>casus belli</i>.
There was, however, a responsive flash in her eye,
which showed she was game in any quarrel. No
tender solicitude animated her lest unintentionally
she had wounded the feelings of this pilgrim and
stranger. He had taken the liberty to be offended
when no offense was intended, and perhaps
with the laudable desire to give him, as it
were, something to cry for, she struck back as best
she might.</p>

<p>“Not so sober ez some o’ them folks ye gin yer
show afore, over yander at the Notch. I hearn
they war fit ter weep an’ pray arterward. Mam
’lowed ye made ’em sober fur sure.”</p>

<p>He was genuinely nettled at this thrust. His
feats of jugglery had resulted so contrary to his
expectations, had roused so serious a danger, that
he did not even in his own thoughts willingly revert
to them. He turned away on one heel of the
pointed russet shoes that had impressed the denizens
of Etowah Cove hardly less unpleasantly than
a cloven hoof, and looked casually down the long
darkly lustrous vista of the river; for the mill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
so projected over the water that the point of view
was as if it were anchored in midstream. The
green boughs leaned far over the smooth shadowy
current; here and there, where a half-submerged
rock lifted its jagged summit above the surface,
the water foamed preternaturally white in the
sylvan glooms. He had a cursory impression
of many features calculated to give pleasure to the
eye, were his mind at ease to enjoy such trifles,
and his sense alert to mark them: the moss on the
logs, and the lichen; the tangle of the trumpet-vines,
all the budding tendrils blowing with the
breeze, that clambered over the rickety structure,
and hung down from the apex of the high roof,
and swayed above the portal; even the swift
motion of a black snake swimming sinuously in
the clear water, and visible through the braiding
of the currents as through corrugated glass.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, his teeth set together, his eyes
still far down the stream, “I did my little best,
but my entertainment was not a success; and if
that fact makes you merry, I wish you joy of your
mirth.”</p>

<p>His eyes returned to her expectantly; he was
not altogether unused to sounding the cultivated
feminine heart, trained to sensibility and susceptible
to many a specious sophistry. Naught he had
found more efficacious than an appeal for sympathy
to those who have sympathy in bulk and on
call. The attribution, also, of a motive trenching
on cruelty, and unauthorized by fact, was usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
wont to occasion a flutter of protest and contrition.</p>

<p>Euphemia Sims met his gaze in calm silence.
She had intended no mirth at his expense, and if
he were minded to evolve it gratuitously he was
welcome to his illusion. Aught that she had said
had been to return or parry a blow. She spoke
advisedly. There was no feigning of gentleness
in her, no faltering nor turning back. She stood
stanchly ready to abide by her words. She had
known no assumption of that pretty superficial
feminine <i>tendresse</i>, so graceful a garb of identity,
and she could not conceive of him as an object of
pity because her sarcasm had cut deeper than his
own. He had an impression that he had indeed
reached primitive conditions. The encounter with
an absolute candor shocked his mental prepossessions
as a sudden dash of cold water might startle
the nerves.</p>

<p>He was all at once very tired of the mill, extremely
tired of his companion. The very weight
of the fishing-rod and its unbaited hook was a
burden. He was making haste to take himself off—he
hardly knew where—from one weariness of
spirit to another. Despite the lesson he had had,
that he would receive of her exactly the measure
of consideration that he meted out, he could not
refrain from a half-mocking intimation as he said,
“And do you propose to take up your abode down
here, that you linger so long in this watery place,—a
nymph, a naiad, or a grace?” He glanced
slightingly down the dusky bosky vista.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>She was not even discomfited by his manner.
“I kem down hyar,” she remarked, the interest
of her errand paramount for the moment, “I kem
down ter the mill ter see ef I couldn’t find some
seconds. They make a sort o’ change arter eatin’
white flour awhile.”</p>

<p>He was not culinary in his tastes, and he had
no idea what “seconds” might be, unless indeed
he encountered them in their transmogrified estate
as rolls on the table.</p>

<p>“And having found them, may I crave the pleasure
of escorting you up the hill to the paternal
domicile? I observe the shadows are growing very
long.”</p>

<p>“You-uns may kerry the bag,” she replied, with
composure, “an’ I’ll kerry the fishin’-pole.”</p>

<p>Thus it was he unexpectedly found himself plodding
along the romantic road he had so lately traversed,
with a bag of “seconds” on his shoulder,—“a
veritable beast of burden,” he said sarcastically
to himself,—while Euphemia Sims’s light,
airy figure loitered along the perfumed ways in
advance of him, her cloudy curls waving slightly
with the motion and the breeze; the fishing-rod
was over her shoulder, and on the end of it where
the unbaited hook was wound with the line her
green sunbonnet was perched, flouncing like some
great struggling thing that the angler had caught.</p>

<p>It did not occur to him, so impressed was he
with the grotesque office to which he had descended
and the absurd result of the interview, that her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
errand to the mill must have anticipated some burlier
strength than her own to carry the “seconds”
home, until as they turned an abrupt curve where
the high rocks rose on either side they met a man
with an axe in his hand walking rapidly toward
them. He paused abruptly at the sight of them,
and the juggler laughed aloud in scornful derision
of his burden.</p>

<p>Then recognizing Ormsby he cried out cheerily,
“Hello, friend, whither bound?” So acute had
his sensibilities become that he had a sense of
recoil from the surly mutinous stare with which
his friendly young acquaintance of the previous
evening received his greeting. Ormsby mumbled
something about a fish-trap and passed on swiftly
toward the river. Swift as he was it was obviously
impossible that he could even have gained
the margin and returned without a pause when
he passed again, walking with a long rapid stride,
swinging his axe doggedly, his hat pulled down
over his brow, his eyes downcast, and with not even
a flimsy affectation of an exchange of civilities.</p>

<p>“Now, the powers forbid,” thought the juggler,
“that I shall run into any such hornet’s nest as
interfering with this Corydon and Phyllis. Surely
sufficient vials of wrath have been poured out on
my head without uncorking this peculiar and
deadly essence of jealousy which all three of us
cannot hope to survive.”</p>

<p>He looked anxiously up from his bent posture,
carrying the bag well up on his shoulders, at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
quickly disappearing figure of the young mountaineer.
He did not doubt that Ormsby knew
that Euphemia’s domestic errands would probably
bring her to the mill at this hour, and the bearing
home of the bag of “seconds” was his precious
dévoir most ruthlessly usurped. “I only wish, my
friend,” thought the juggler, “that you had the
heavy thing now with all its tender associations.”
He glanced with some solicitude at the delicate
lovely face of the girl. It was placidity itself. He
had begun to be able to read it. There was an
implication of exactions in its soft firmness. She
would make no concessions. She would assume no
blame not justly and fairly to be laid at her door.
She would not rend her heart with those tender lies
of false self-accusation common to loving women
who find it less bitter to censure themselves than
those they love, and sometimes indeed more politic.
She would not bewail herself that she had not lingered,
that Ormsby, who came daily to examine
his fish-traps, might have had the opportunity of a
long talk with her which he coveted, and the precious
privilege of going home like a mule with a
flour-bag on his back. It was his own fault that
he was too late. She could not heft the bag. If
he were angry he was a fool. On every principle
it is a bad thing to be a fool. If God Almighty
has not seen fit to make a man a fool, it is an ill
turn for a man to make one of himself.</p>

<p>As the juggler divined her mental processes and
the possible indifference of her sentiments toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
the disappointed Ormsby, he realized that naught
was to be hoped from her, but that probably
Ormsby himself might be less obdurate. Doubtless
he had had experience of the stern and unyielding
quality of her convictions, and had learned
that it was the part of wisdom to accommodate
himself to them. Surely he would not indulge so
futile an anger, for it would not move her. After
an interval of solitary sulking in the dank cool
woods his resentment would wane, his jealousy
would prompt a more zealous rivalry, and he would
come to her father’s house as the evening wore on
with an incidental expression of countenance and
a lamblike manner. The juggler made haste because
of this sanguine expectation to leave the field
clear for the reconciliation of the parties in interest.
He deprecated the loss of one of the very
few friends, among the many enemies, he had
made since his advent into Etowah Cove. The
frank, bold, kindly young mountaineer had, in the
absence of all other prepossessions, somewhat won
the good opinion of the juggler. With that attraction
which mere youth has for youth, he valued
Ormsby above the other denizens of the Cove.
Jane Ann Sims was possessed of more sterling
worth as a friend than a battalion of such as
Ormsby. But the juggler was a man of prejudices.
Mrs. Sims’s unwieldy bulk offended his
artistic views of proportion. The slow shuffle of
her big feet on the floor as she went about irritated
his nerves. The creases and dimples of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
broad countenance obscured for him its expression
of native astuteness and genuine good will. Therefore,
despite her appreciation of the true intent of
the feats of a prestidigitator he was impatient of
her presence and undervalued her hearty prepossessions
in his favor. He heard with secret annoyance
her voice vaguely wheezing a hymn, much off
the key, as after supper she sat knitting a shapeless
elephantine stocking beside the dying embers,
for the night was chilly. Her husband now and
again yawned loudly over his pipe, as much from
perplexity as fatigue. Outside Euphemia was
sitting alone on the step of the passage. The juggler
had no inclination to linger by her side. Except
for a lively appreciation of the difference in
personal appearance she was not more attractive to
him than was her mother. He passed stiffly by,
with a sense of getting out of harm’s way, and ascended
to his room in the roof, where for a long
time he lay in the floundering instabilities of the
feather-bed, which gave him now and again a sensation
as of drowning in soft impalpable depths,—a
sensation especially revolting to his nerves.
Nevertheless, it was but vaguely that he realized
that Ormsby did not come, that he heard the movements
downstairs as the doors were closed, and
when he opened his eyes again it was morning,
and the new day marked a change.</p>

<p>If anything were needed to further his alienation
from the beautiful daughter of the house, it might
have been furnished by her own voice, the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
sounds of which that reached his ears were loud
and somewhat unfilial.</p>

<p>“It’s a plumb sin not ter milk a cow reg’lar ter
the minit every day,” she averred dictatorially.</p>

<p>“Show me the chapter an’ verse fur that, ef it’s
a sin; ye air book-l’arned,” wheezed her mother,
on the defensive.</p>

<p>“I ain’t lookin’ in the Bible fur cow-l’arnin’,”
retorted Euphemia. “There’s nuthin’ in the
Bible ter make a fool of saint or sinner.”</p>

<p>“Thar’s mo’ cows spoke of in the Bible ’n ever
you see,” persisted Mrs. Sims, glad of the diversion.
“Jacob hed thousands o’ cattle, an’ Aberham
thousands, an’ Laban thousands, not ter
count Joseph’s ten lean kine an’ ten fat kine,
what I reckon war never viewed out’n a dream,
an’ mought be accounted visions.”</p>

<p>“Waal, I ain’t ez well pervided with cattle ez
them folks, neither sleepin’ nor wakin’,” said Euphemia.
“I ’lowed ye’d milk pore Spot reg’lar
like I does, else I wouldn’t hev gone away.”</p>

<p>“I slep’ till nigh supper-time,” apologized Mrs.
Sims unctuously, pricked in conscience at last,
“else I’d hev done it. Want me ter go walkin’
in my sleep, an’ milk the cow?”</p>

<p>Euphemia said no more, but there rose an energetic
clashing of pans and kettles, intimating that
the explanation had not mitigated the enormity of
the offense. It was with a distinct sentiment of
apprehension that the juggler made himself ready
and descended the stairs. The place was evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
under martial law. The slipshod, easy-going liberty
which had characterized it was a thing of the
past. He might hardly have recognized it, so
different was the atmosphere, but for the fixtures.
The perfumed air swept through and through the
rooms that he had found so close, from open window
to open door. The floors had been scrubbed
white, and were still but half dry. The breakfast-table
was set in the passage, and the graceful vines
which grew over the aperture at the rear showed
the morning sunshine only in tiny interstices, as
they waved back and forth with a fluctuating glimmer
and an undertone of rustlings and murmurs;
through the drooping boughs of the elm at the
opposite entrance might be caught glimpses of the
silver river and the gray rocks and the purple
mountains afar off.</p>

<p>Here he found Euphemia and her parents. The
irate flush was still red on the young girl’s cheeks,
and her eyes were bright with the stern elation of
victory. But if submission entailed on Mrs. Sims
no effort, she was not averse to subjugation. The
juggler was pleased for once to perceive no diminution
in the number and depth of her dimples as
she welcomed him.</p>

<p>“Ye’ll hev ter put up with Phemie’s cookin’,
now. I don’t b’lieve in no old ’oman cookin’
whenst she hev got a spry young darter ter do it
fur her. I reckon ye’ll manage ter make out.
She does toler’ble well fur her, bein’ inexperienced
an’ sech; but I can’t sense it into the gal how ter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
git some sure enough strong rich taste on ter the
vittles.”</p>

<p>Old Sims’s grizzled, stubbly, unshaven countenance
expressed a rigid neutrality, as if he intended
to abide by this impartiality or perish in
the attempt. His art had sufficed to keep him out
of the engagement this morning, and his success
had confirmed his resolution.</p>

<p>It seemed afterward to the juggler that this
meal saved his life. He ate as if he had not tasted
food for a week. He partook of mountain trout
broiled on the coals, and of “that most delicate
cate” constructed of Indian meal and called the
corn dodger. The potatoes were roasted in the
ashes with their jackets on, and crumbled to powder
at the touch of a fork. He drank cream instead
of buttermilk,—it had been too much trouble
for Mrs. Sims to skim the big pans when she
could tilt the churn instead; and there was a kind
of dry, crisp, crusty roll compounded of the seconds
that he had brought to the house on his shoulder
yesterday, and which was eaten with honey
and the honeycomb. He watched the river shimmer
between the green willows of the banks. He
noted the white mists rise on the purple mountain
sides, glitter prismatically in the sun, tenuously
dissolve in fleecy fragments, and vanish in mid-air.
The faint tinkle of a sheep-bell sounded,—pastoral,
peaceful; he heard a thrush singing with so
fresh, so matutinal a delight in its tones.</p>

<p>“If this is the line of march,” he said to himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
as he maintained a decorous silence, for the
state of the temper of the family was too precarious
to admit of conversation, “I don’t care how
soon I fall into ranks.”</p>

<p>It is supposed by those who affect to know that
the seat of the intellectual faculties is the cerebrum
situated in the brain-pan. Still, science
cannot deny that the stomach is a singularly intelligent
organ. Through its processes alone the juggler
perceived how well subjection becomes parents,
especially a female parent addicted to the use of
the frying-pan; realized Euphemia’s strength of
character, unusual in so young a person, and conceived
a deep respect for her mental and industrial
capacities. He appreciated an incongruity in his
bantering style and his mocking high-sounding
phrases. His manner toward her became characterized
by a studious although apparently incidental
courtesy, which was, however, compatible
with a certain cautious avoidance.</p>

<p>These days passed eventlessly to him. Much of
the time he strolled listlessly about, so evidently
immersed in some absorbing mental perturbation
that Tubal Sims marveled that its indicia should
not attract the attention of the womenfolk, who
esteemed themselves so keen of discernment in
such matters. He still affected to angle at times,
but his hook was hardly less efficient when it dangled
bare and farcical in the deep dark pool than
when the forlorn minnow it pierced stirred an
eddy in the shadowy depths. He did not seem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
annoyed by his non-success. Mrs. Sims’s banter
scarcely grated on his nerves or touched his pride.
But indeed Mrs. Sims herself did not think ill of
the unachieving; somehow the aggressive capability
of Euphemia made her lenient. If there were
more people like Euphemia, Mrs. Sims might
have felt in conscience bound to move on herself.
As to the daughter, her little world hastily conformed
itself to its dictator, and she ruled it with
an absolute sway. Triumphs of baking or butter-making
ministered amply to her pride. Even the
dumb creatures seemed ambitious to meet her expectations
and avoid her censure. The dogs, who
had sat so thick around the hearthstone in her
absence as to edge away the human household, and
had so independently tracked mud over the floors,
now never ventured nearer than the threshold; yet
there was much complimentary wagging of tails
when she appeared on the porch. Sometimes the
clatter of the treadle and the thumping of the batten
told that the great loom in the shed-room was
astir. Sometimes the spinning-wheel whirred.
Occasionally she was busily carding cotton, and
again she was hackling flax.</p>

<p>One afternoon he found her differently employed.
She sat near the window and caught the waning
light upon the newspaper which she held with both
arms half outstretched as she read aloud. Mrs.
Sims glanced up at the young man with a radiance
of maternal pride that duplicated every crease and
every dimple. Even Tubal Sims, who, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
juggler had fancied of late, was wont to look at
his guest askance, lifted his eyes now with a smile
distending his gruff, lined countenance, as he sat
with his arms folded in his shirt-sleeves across
his breast, his chair tilted back on its hind legs
against the frame of the opposite window, his gaze
reverting immediately to the young elocutionist.
With a good-natured impulse to minister to the
satisfaction of the old couple, the juggler silently
took a chair hard by, and suppressed his rising
sense of ridicule.</p>

<p>For, alack, Euphemia’s accomplishments were
indeed of manual achievement. He listened with
surprise that this should be the extent of her
vaunted book-learning, knowing naught of how
scanty were her opportunities, and what labor this
poor proficiency had cost. Subjugation is possible
only to superior force. In the instant his former
attitude of mind toward her had returned, on this
pitiful exhibition of incapacity which she herself
and her prideful parents were totally incompetent
to realize. She droned on in a painful sing-song,
now floundering heavily among unaccustomed
words, now spelling aloud one more difficult than
the others, while he had much ado to keep the contemptuous
laugh from his face, aware that now
and again his countenance was anxiously yet triumphantly
perused by the delighted old people, to
lose no token of his appreciation and wonder.</p>

<p>To bear this scrutiny more successfully he sought
to occupy his thoughts in other matters. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
practiced eye noted even at the distance that the
newspaper must be some county sheet,—published
perhaps in the town of Colbury. He congratulated
himself that the girl had evidently exhausted
the columns of local news, and was now deep in
the contents of what is known as the “patent outside.”
Otherwise his polite martyrdom might
have been of greater duration. He felt that neither
her interest nor that of her audience would
long sustain her in the wider range of subjects and
the more varied and unaccustomed vocabulary of
the articles, copied from many sources, which made
up this portion of the journal.</p>

<p>The next moment he could have torn it from her
hands. His heart gave a great bound and seemed
to stand still. His eyes were fixed and shining.
He half rose from his chair; then by an absolute
effort resumed his seat and resolutely held himself
still. In the throe of an inexpressible suspense
every fibre of his being was stretched to its extremest
tension as, slowly, laboriously, pausing
often, the drawling voice read on anent “Young
Lucien Royce. Details of his Terrible Death.”
For so the head-lines ran.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> account which the newspaper made shift to
give was but a bald, disjointed recital of the superficial
aspect of events to one whose memory could
so nearly reproduce the vivid fact; and where
memory and experience failed him, his imagination,
conversant with the status depicted, could
paint the scene with all the tints of actuality. A
recent steamboat accident on the great Mississippi
River had resulted in much loss of life. The words,
as Euphemia droned them, still holding the newspaper
with both arms outstretched, brought back
to one of her listeners the sensation of forging
tremulously along in midstream at nightfall, the
shimmer of the shaking chandeliers of the great
flimsy floating palace, the white interior of the
ladies’ cabin, with the “china finish” of the
painted and paneled walls, its velvet carpet and
furniture, its grand piano. He heard anew the
throb of the engines, and the rush of water from
the great revolving wheels; he had the sense, too,
of the immensity of the vast river, gleaming with
twinkling points of light close at hand, where the
waves caught the glitter from the illuminated
craft, and tossed it from one to another as the
surges of the displaced water broke about the hull;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
further away could be seen the swift current hurrying
on, a different dusky tint from the darkness;
and still further, where the limits of vision were
reached, one had even yet some subtle realization
of that unceasing irresistible flow, although unseen
and unheard. He remembered leaning over the
guards and idly watching a number of mules on
the deck below, crowded so thickly that they
seemed only a dark restlessly stirring mass, until
at some landing, when they were excited by the
clamors of the roustabouts loading on more cotton,
the pallid glare of the electric light rendered distinguishable
the tossing snorting heads and wild
dilated eyes. An ill-starred cargo! The frantic
struggles of this animated mass caused much loss
of human life; many a bold swimmer might have
gained the land but for the uncontrolled plunging
of those heavy hoofs. And there was no lack of
light to reveal the full horrors of the fate: those
huge piles of bales of blazing cotton illumined the
river for twenty miles. How unprescient, how
strangely stolid, the human organism, the phlegmatic
mind, the insensate soul, that no nerve, no
faint tremor of fear or forecast, no vague presentiment,
heralded the moment when every condition
of life was reversed!</p>

<p>Up in the pilot-house he was now, with the captain
and the pilot and the great shadowy wheel.
The ladies had all vanished, leaving the cabin below
deserted and a trifle forlorn. Once he had
taken his way through those sacred precincts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
affecting to be searching for some one; and so he
was,—to discover if any one there was worth
looking at twice: and this he esteemed a justifiable
if not a laudable enterprise, for were the ladies
not welcome to look at him? His trim business
suit he felt was quite the correct thing. He had
entire confidence in his tailor, and he swore by
his barber! His proper thankfulness to his Creator,
too, was not impaired by any morbid self-depreciation.
With his strong, alert, handsome
figure, his dark red-brown hair, his eyes of the
same tint, only kindled into fire, his long dark
lashes, his drooping mustache, and the features
with which nature had taken some very particular
pains,—the ladies were quite welcome not to turn
their heads away, if they chose.</p>

<p>However, his vanity was not insatiable. He
had made his triumphal progress through the circle
earlier in the evening, and now he was relishing
the captain’s surprised laughter at sundry feats
that he was exhibiting with a silver dollar and
a goblet which did not always hold water. One
moment the silver dollar was under it, glimmering
affably through the thin glass; then, with
no human approach to it, the goblet was empty.
It seemed the problem of life to the jolly captain
to discover how this was done, and being an ambitious
wight, he assured his passenger, with a wild
wager of ten dollars to nothing, that, after the
boat should leave the bank again, he would be able
to do the trick himself before they could make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
another landing. Before they made another landing
he was initiated into deeper mysteries.</p>

<p>The boat was heading slowly for the shore.
For the whistle, in loud husky amplitudes of
sound, overpowering when heard so close at hand,
had broken abruptly on the air, and the echoes of
all the wild moss-draped cypress woods on either
hand were answering the accustomed sound through
the dark aisles of the swamp. To many a far
cabin up lonely bayous they carried the note of
the progress of “de big boat up de ribber.” The
great tremulous craft was swinging majestically
round in midstream. Now and again sounded the
sharp jangling of the pilot’s bell. Then the boat
paused with a quivering shock, backed, veered to
one side, approached the shore, paused again, and
then smoothly glided forward, trembled anew, and
was still.</p>

<p>He had gone out on the hurricane deck. The
wind blew fresh from the opposite shore; he was
sensible of a certain attraction in the aspect of
the gloom which was as above a darkling sea, for
the further bank was hardly visible by day, and
utterly effaced by night. The stars were in the
water as well as in the sky. He looked up at
them above the two dusky columns of the boat’s
chimneys, which were bejeweled now with swinging
lights. The sudden stillness of the machinery
gave one to hear the sounds from the land.
A crane clanged out a wild woodsy cry from
somewhere in the darkness. An owl, hooting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
from the bank, sent its voice of ill omen far along
the currents of the great deep silent river. The
clamor from the landing caught his attention, and
he turned back to look down at the cluster of
twinkling lights,—for the place was a mere hamlet.
And but for the shifting of his attitude,—oh,
could he but have contented his gaze with the
sad spring night by the riverside, the lonely woods,
the waste of waters, the reflection of the stars in
the depths and the stars themselves in the infinite
heights of the dark sky,—could this have sufficed,
he said to himself as the girl read aloud the story
of his fate, he might be living now.</p>

<p>For alive as the man looked, he was dead!</p>

<p>And the end of Lucien Royce—for this was his
real name—came to pass in this way.</p>

<p>That night, as he shifted his position on the
hurricane deck, a young fellow coming up the
broad landing-stage amongst the neighborhood
loafers bound to take a drink at the bar of every
passing steamboat, caught sight of him in the
steady pervasive radiance of the electric search-light
now aflare on the boat, and lifted his voice
in a friendly hail. This young fellow was very
visible in the warm spring afternoon in the far-away
mountains, where he had never been. The
juggler inadvertently glanced down at the russet
shoes on his feet, for this man had then stood in
them. It was he who wore, that night, the long
blue hose, the blue flannel shirt, the black-and-red
blazer, the knickerbockers, and the tan-colored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
belt, which was drawn an eyelet or so tighter now,
for the juggler was slighter of build. Notified by
the whistle of the boat of its approach, he had
come down to the landing on his bicycle, merely
for the break in the monotony of a long visit at a
relative’s plantation. Royce remembered how this
other fellow had looked in this toggery, grown so
familiar, as they stood together at the bar, and he
asked of the newcomer more than once what he
would take. Very jolly they were together at the
bar. It was hard to part. Lucien Royce could
scarcely resist the pressing insistence to return at
an early day and visit this friend at his sister’s
place, a few miles back from the river, where he
himself was a guest. But John Grayson was the
prodigal son in an otherwise irreproachable family,
and Royce preferred more responsible introduction
to make his welcome good. With this hampering
thought in mind he was not apt at excuses. John
Grayson, noting that he was ill at ease, instantly
attributed it to commercial anxiety, and asked,
with rude curiosity, how his firm was weathering
the flurry. For this was a time of extreme financial
stress. A general panic was in progress.
Assignments were announced by the dozen daily.
The banks were going down one upon another,
like a row of falling bricks. With business much
extended, with heavy margins to cover and notes
for large amounts about to fall due, the cotton
commission firm, Greenhalge, Gould &amp; Fife, of
St. Louis, of which his late father had been a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
partner, and of which he was an employee, had
made great efforts to collect all the money due
them in the lower country, and Lucien Royce had
been sent south on this mission. He had succeeded
beyond their expectations. Owing to the
prevalent total lack of confidence in the banks,
he had been instructed to transmit a considerable
sum by express. This, however, was promptly attached
in the express office at St. Louis to satisfy
a claim against the firm; and although they were
advised it could not be sustained in court, the
proceeding greatly embarrassed them, being, in
fact, designed at this crisis to force a compromise
in order to release the surplus funds. To furnish
security proved impossible under the circumstances;
and the firm being thus balked, Royce telegraphed
in cipher to them for authority to bring the remainder
home on his person, that it might be in
readiness to take up their paper. Although he
was rarely troubled by the weight of the money-belt
which he thus wore, containing a large sum
in bills and specie, he was very conscious of it now
when Grayson, who with all the rest of St. Louis
had heard of the attachment suit, abruptly demanded,
with a knitting of his brow, “How in the
world do you get your collections to them, if you
can’t send the money by express or draft?”</p>

<p>Royce controlled his face, and replied evasively,
“Oh, the financial situation is on the mend now.
As to the firm, it will pull through all right, without
a doubt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>John Grayson listened, his auburn head cocked
to one side. He winked a roguish dark eye.
Then, with a sudden jocose lunge at his friend, he
slipped his arm around his waist, feeling there the
heavy roll of the belt, and burst into rollicking
laughter. The scuffling demonstration—for Royce
had violently resisted—was eyed with stately disapproval
by an elderly planter of the old régime,
who possessed now more manners than means; evidently
contrasting the public “horse-play,” as he
doubtless considered it, of these representatives
of the present day with the superior deportment of
the youth of the punctilious past.</p>

<p>Lucien Royce remembered that he had been
secretly perturbed after this, for he knew that
Grayson drank to excess and talked wildly in his
cups; and although, in view of his own safety, he
would hardly have cared to make public the character
of his charge, he realized with positive dismay
that it might be fatal to the interests of the
firm should he encounter some legal process at the
wharf in St. Louis, the result of this discovery.</p>

<p>But he was simple-hearted, after all. He did
not suspect John Grayson of aught dishonorable.
To the world at large he seemed a fine young
fellow, of excellent forbears, merely sowing his
wild oats,—a crop which many men have harvested
in early years with scant profit, it is true,
but without derogation to common honesty and
repute.</p>

<p>Royce subsequently sought to urge in compassion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
for his friend that the turpitude of the crime
was insomuch the less that it was not deliberate
and premeditated. Certain it was that Grayson’s
cry of amazement and his plunge toward the guards
were very like the precipitancy of dismay when he
found that the huge boat was sheering off; she
was turning as he dashed down the stair, and was
headed once more on her course when he realized
that in their conviviality he and his friend had
failed to hear the sonorous panting of the engines
again astir, the jangling of the bell, the heavy
plashing of the buckets striking the water as the
wheels revolved anew, and that the landing was
now a mile down the river.</p>

<p>The captain showed much polite concern when
the two young men resorted hastily to the “texas”
and found him seated at a table, eying, with an
air of great cunning and a robust intention to solve
the mystery forthwith, a silver dollar which was
securely invested under an inverted glass goblet,
and which, so far as his powers were capable of
extricating it thence, save by the rule of thumb,
as it were, was the safest silver dollar ever known.</p>

<p>He desisted from this occupation for the moment
to master the new perplexity that confronted him,
and to express his most affable and ceremonious
regret; for his boat carried all the cotton shipped
from the rich sister’s plantation, and the dictates of
policy aided his constitutionally kindly disposition.</p>

<p>“Why, I wouldn’t have kidnapped you this way
for”—his eye fell on the bit of silver shining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
through the goblet—“for a dollar,” he concluded
modestly. “I’ll put you ashore in the yawl, if
you like. I would turn down-stream and land
again, but”—he faced half round from the table,
with the lightness characteristic of some portly
men, and sat with one hand on the back of the
chair, and the other on the goblet—“but the
truth is I’m running pretty much on one wheel;
there was an accident to the other before we were
a hundred miles from New Orleans, and with this
wind blowing straight across the river it’s mighty
difficult getting out from the left bank; she can
hardly climb against the current.”</p>

<p>John Grayson appeared for a moment to contemplate
the suggestion of going ashore in the
yawl. The wind came in a great gust through the
towering chimneys, the lights flickered, the texas
seemed to rock upon the superstructure of the hurricane
deck. “I don’t believe I care to be on the
river in a yawl in this wind, this dark night,”
he said, evidently debating the matter within himself.</p>

<p>“Then go to St. Louis and back with us!” exclaimed
the hospitable captain. “Shan’t cost you
a cent, of course. We’ll make our next landing
a little after midnight, I reckon, and I’ll telegraph
Mrs. Halliday from there.”</p>

<p>The jovial evening seemed to the juggler, as he
listened to the girl reading aloud, and stared at
her with eyes blank of expression and that introverted
look which follows mental processes rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
than material objects, like an experience in another
planet, so far away it was, as if so long ago. He
remembered that he scarcely dared to touch a glass,
with the consciousness of the treasure he carried
in the belt he wore and all its interdependent interests,
but John Grayson drank blithely enough,
and the generous liquor relaxed beyond all precedent
his loosely hinged tongue. Lucien Royce
kept close by his side as he wandered about the
boat, having developed a fear that he would tell
the secret that had come so unwarrantably into his
possession; and when the captain asked as a favor
that, on account of the crowded condition of the
boat, Royce would share his stateroom with the
guest, he acceded at once, preferring to have Grayson
able to talk only to him until such time as he
should be once more duly sober.</p>

<p>He consigned the guest to the upper berth,
thinking that thus Grayson could not leave the
stateroom without his knowledge. He lay awake
by a great effort until he was sure from the snores
of his jovial friend that Grayson was asleep; and
when he dropped into slumber himself, as he was
young and tired, having been much in the open
air that day, to which he was unaccustomed in his
clerical vocation, he slept like a log.</p>

<p>His consciousness was renewed, after a blank
interval, with the sense of being awakened in his
berth by a violent jar, and of striving to rouse
himself, and of falling asleep again. Another interval
of blankness, and he remembered definitely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
the grasp of John Grayson’s hand on his shoulder,
roughly shaking him, with the terrified announcement
that there was something the matter. He
experienced a sort of surprise that John Grayson
was in the stateroom; then—it was strange that
his mind should have thus taken cognizance of
trifles—he recalled the crowded condition of the
boat, and realized that his friend was leaping
down from the upper berth. He stated, with
drowsy dignity, that he did not care a damn what
was the matter; that he had paid for his stateroom,
which was more than <i>some</i> people could say,
and that if he were not allowed to sleep in it, he
would give bond that he would know the reason
why.</p>

<p>The next thing of which he was aware was a
flash of light in the room. The door had opened
from the saloon, and a clerk had put in his head
to say that there was no danger. The boat had
struck a snag, it was true, but the damage was
slight. Somehow Royce slept but lightly after
this. The unreasoning sense of impending misfortune
had come to him at last. Presently he was
awake and conscious that he was alone. He lifted
himself on his elbow and listened. What was that
low roar? The wind? That sound of banging
timbers must be the flapping of shutters or doors
as the gust rushed across the river. He heard a
clamor on the boiler deck. Voices?—or was it
the wind, screaming wildly as it went? And why
did they run the engines at that furious rate? He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
could feel the strain of the machinery in the very
floor under his feet.</p>

<p>As he slipped out of the lower berth he perceived
that the gray dawn was in the contracted
little room; he could see through the glass of the
door opening on the guards the tawny-tinted
stretches of water, the sad-hued cypress woods on
a distant bank, draped with fog as well as with
hanging moss, and down the stream the whiter
tints of an island of sand covered with sparse vegetation,
locally known as a “tow-head,” for which
the disabled boat was running with every pound
of pressure which the engines could carry. There
was, in truth, something the matter, for the tow-head
would have been given a wide berth in a normal
state of affairs; getting aground, when the
lesser of two evils, showed a crisis indeed.</p>

<p>He looked about hastily for his clothes. They
were gone, and in their place John Grayson’s toggery
lay in a heap. In his panic and the darkness
Grayson had probably caught the garments nearest
to his hand. His deserted friend hastily invested
himself in the suit of clothes that John Grayson
had left. As he was drawing on the blazer, suddenly
a hoarse cry smote his ear. “No bottom!”
sang out the leadsman. They were taking soundings.
“No-o bottom!” And he felt the vibrations
of the tone in the very fibres of his quaking
heart.</p>

<p>He plunged out at the door on the guards, and
as he stood there gasping for a moment he realized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
the situation. The boat was sinking fast; evidently
in striking a snag the craft had sprung a
leak. He saw on the deck the frightened passengers
huddled together in groups, here and there
a man anxiously fastening life-preservers on the
women and children of his kindred. Again the
leadsman’s cry, “No-o bottom!” floated mournfully
over the water, and the frantic panting of
the engines seemed redoubled. He saw the captain,
cool and collected, at his post; the other officers
appeared now and again among the groups
of passengers, soothing, reassuring, and doubtless
their lies were condoned for the mercy of the intention.
As he passed on amongst them all, nowhere
did he catch a glimpse of John Grayson.
“If I didn’t know the fellow wouldn’t play such
a fool trick at such a time, I’d think he was dodging
me,” he muttered. The next moment he had
forgotten him utterly.</p>

<p>“Deep four!” called the leadsman.</p>

<p>As Royce listened he stood still, holding his
breath in suspense.</p>

<p>“Mark three!” called the leadsman, sounding
again.</p>

<p>Royce heard the plunging of his heart as distinctly
as the echoes of the cry clanging from the
shore. But suddenly they were blended with a
new refrain,—“A quarter twain!”</p>

<p>He gave a great sigh of relief, and checked it
midway to listen anew.</p>

<p>“Mark twain!” called the leadsman, with a
new intonation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>There was no longer doubt,—they were in shallow
water. A great exclamation of delight rose
from the crowd. The very hope was like a rescue,—the
relief from the blank despair! Here and
there the hysterical sobbings of the women told of
the slackening of the tension of suspense.</p>

<p>“Quarter less twain!” cried the leadsman,
sounding anew.</p>

<p>The juggler remembered how free he had felt,
how safe. The boat, even if her engines could not
run her aground, would soon settle in shallow
water, and rescue would come with some passing
steamer.</p>

<p>A blinding glare, a thunderous detonation that
seemed to shatter his every nerve, and he was weltering
in the river; now sinking down with a sense
of the weight of infinite fathoms of water upon
him, and now mechanically trying to strike out
with an unreasoning instinct like an animal’s.
When he could understand what had happened he
was swimming fairly well, although greatly hampered
by the clinging blazer that John Grayson
had left on the floor, and which he now wore.
The long reaches of the river, the shore, the dim
dawn, were all lighted with a lurid glare; for the
boat had taken fire with the explosion of the overstrained
boiler. The roar of the flames mingled
with the heart-rending screams of those whom
hope had so cruelly deluded. But the sounds were
all faint at the distance, and he never could understand
how he had been thrown, unhurt, so far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
away. He saw none of the human victims of the
disaster. Now and again charred timbers, shooting
by on the current, threatened him, and to avoid
them necessitated some skillful management. A
far greater danger was the proximity of two
horses, also gallantly swimming, who followed him
with loud whinnies of inquiry and distress, appealing
in their way for aid and guidance, leaning on
the humankind as if recognizing his superior capacity.
More than once, one of them, a spirited
mare, intended for new triumphs at the Louisville
races, swam close in front of him, pausing, as if
to say, “Mount, and let us gallop off on dry
ground;” deflecting his course, which was already
beset with abnormal difficulties. For when almost
exhausted, he saw that the land he was approaching,
half veiled with the gray fog, was a bluff
bank, thirty feet high at least, and as far as eye
could reach up and down the river there was no
lower ground. To scale it was impossible. His
heart sank within him. He felt that his stroke
was the feebler when hope no longer nerved it. In
his despair he could hardly make another effort.
And although he had feared the horses, with their
lashing hoofs and their unearthly cries, when the
mare—the more importunate in dumb insistence
that he would succor them—threw up her head,
and with a wild inarticulate scream went struggling
down into the depths to rise no more, he felt a
choking sob in his throat, his eyes were blurred,
he could scarcely keep his head above the surface.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
If he were further conscious, the faculty was not
coupled with that of memory, for he never knew
how he came to be in a flatboat floating swiftly
down the stream from the scene of the disaster,
and he never saw his other comrade again. Once
more there came an interval void of perception;
then he was vaguely aware that the flatboat was
tied up in the bight of a bend; the shadowy cypresses
towered above it,—he heard their waving
boughs,—the water lapped gently about it;
then blankness again, and he never knew how
long this continued.</p>

<p>One morning he awoke, restored to his senses,
in a bunk against the wall; he felt the motion of
the river, and he knew that the flimsy craft with
the rickety little cabin in its centre was again
afloat upon the stream. Every pulse of the current
set his own pulses a-quiver. The very proximity
of the fearful river induced a physical terror
that his mind could not control. It was only by
a mighty wrench that his thoughts could be forced
from the subject, and fixed as an alternative on
his surroundings. The interior of the cabin consisted
of two apartments: one for bunks and cooking
purposes; the other, apparently, from the
glimpse through a door, fitted up as a store, with
small wares, such as threads and perfumery, soaps
and canned goods, and showy imitation jewelry
calculated to take the eye and the earnings of the
negroes at the various landings where the craft,
locally called the “trading-boat,” tied up. Through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
a further door he had an outlook upon the deck.
An elderly woman with rough red arms was sitting
there on a stool, peeling potatoes; a half-grown
boy, cross-legged on the floor, tailor-wise, was
sawing away on an old fiddle. Beyond still was
the vast spread of the tawny-tinted rippling floods
and the sad hues of the nearer shore. Lucien
Royce recoiled at the very sight and turned away
his eyes. Within, much of the wearing apparel
of the proprietors dangled from the rafters. There
were bunks on the opposite wall, imperfectly visible
through the smoke from the tiny stove, which,
despite a great crackling of driftwood, seemed to
labor with an imperfect draft. Two men were
seated close to it, and were talking with that security
which presumes no alien ear to listen. A certain
crime of robbery absorbed their interest, and
Royce gathered that, fearing they might be implicated
in it, they had silently fled from the locality
before their presence was well recognized. They
had evidently had naught to do with it. They
only wished they had!</p>

<p>A great swag it was, to be sure. The man had
worn a money-belt,—a rare thing in these times.
Heavy it must have been and drawn tight, for
both hands had stiffened on its fastenings as if
striving to tear it off. Its weight had doubtless
drowned him. It was no joke to swim the Mississippi
at high water, completely dressed and with
a tight belt stuffed with money—gold or silver?
And how much could the sum have been? Whenever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
this point was broached, a glitter of greed
was in the eyes of each which made the grizzled-bearded
faces alike despite the variations of contour
and feature. Always a long pause of silent
speculation ensued, and whenever the supposititious
sum total was mentioned, it had augmented
in the interval. No one knew where the man
went down; the body—the face beaten and
bruised by floating timbers out of all semblance to
humanity—had been swept upon a sand-bar.
There some pirates of the river-bank had found it,
had cut the belt open, had taken the money and
fled, leaving the empty belt to tell its own futile
story. At this point the flatboatmen would pause,
and once more gloomily shake their heads and spit
tobacco juice on the tiny stove, till it was as vocal
as a frying-pan, and obviously wish that the chance
had been theirs.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Lucien Royce had been apprised
of John Grayson’s death and of the loss
of the funds with which he himself had been entrusted.
Until this moment he had never missed
the belt. Doubtless Grayson took it from him
at the first alarm of striking the snag before the
dawn, when he vainly sought to rouse his friend
to a sense of danger. Was it possible, he marveled,
that Grayson, leaving him to drown, as he
supposed, had thought that the good money need
not be wasted? Had its custodian been rescued,
however, probably Grayson would have restored
it; otherwise suspicion would have fallen upon him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
since they had occupied the same stateroom. But
if not, if Lucien Royce’s body had gone to the
bottom of the river, and no one the wiser that
the money-belt did not go with it,—was it upon
this chance, in that supreme moment of terror,
that Grayson had had the forethought to act?
He was not a man who made much account of
the rights of others when his own comfort or
his own pleasure was at stake. But his life—did
he risk the precious moment that might mean
existence to save a sum of money for a St. Louis
cotton commission firm of which he did not know
a single member? Would he have jeopardized
his chances in the water with this weight, with
this fatally close-gripping python of a belt, for a
mere commercial matter? It was needless to argue
the question. Royce knew right well, both then
and now, that in no event, had he not survived,
did Grayson intend to restore the money. Evidently
the idea had flashed upon him when, in
seeking to rouse his companion, his hands came in
contact with the belt and the opportunity was his
own. And so Grayson had gone to his death,
drowned by the weight and the pressure of the
stolen money. It seemed a grim sort of justice
that with the last movements of his hands in life,
the last effort of his will, he sought to tear it off,
to cast it from him, as he went down into the hopeless
depths.</p>

<p>Royce experienced hardly a regret for his false
friend,—not more than a physical pang of sympathy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
an involuntary shudder, his very nerves instinct
with the terror of the water. Had Grayson
not tampered with a secret that was not his own,
the belt would now be safe. Royce himself had
had the strength to sustain its weight in the water.
He was used to it, and its size had been carefully
adjusted to his slender figure. Now the money was
gone,—the belt was found on another man. They
would seem to have been confederates in the robbery
of the fund. He was responsible for it. He
could not reasonably account for its being out of
his own possession without incriminating himself.
Should he seek to inculpate the dead man alone,
he was aware that the fact that Grayson could not
speak for himself would speak for him. Nothing
could palliate the circumstance that the belt was
found on another man than its proper custodian,
and that the leather had been slit and the money
extracted. He would have to account for this, and
improbable excuses would not go far with men
smarting under a ruinous loss from the carelessness
or the drunkenness or the cupidity of their
employee. He could not go back. He could
never face the firm!</p>

<p>So light of heart he had always been, so light
of heel, so light, so very light of head, that the
anguish which pierced him at the idea of the loss
of public esteem, of his commercial honor, of the
confidence of the firm, involved in his seeming
failure of probity, subacutely amazed him at its
keen poignancy. He had hardly known how he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
valued these spiritual, immaterial assets. More
than life,—far, far more than life! He began to
contemn the struggle he had made in the water;
he had been wondering and calculating, with an
early gleam of consciousness and an athlete’s stalwart
vanity, how far he had swum, how long he
had sustained himself in the great flood; for what
purpose, he thought now, what melancholy purpose,
to save his life for the ignominy of an episode
behind the bars for breach of trust, embezzlement,
robbery—he hardly cared what might be
the technical rank of the crime of which he would
so certainly be accused. Every reflection brought
confirmations of the popular suspicion which would
be so false, and which could not, alas, be disproved.
With a mechanical review, as of a life when it is
closed, sundry gambling escapades of John Grayson’s
recurred to his mind, in which he had been
nearly concerned and which had attained a certain
degree of notoriety. On one occasion, indeed,
when he was younger and more easily led by his
friend, a gambling establishment had been raided
by the police, the two had been among the captured
players, and being arraigned, although under false
names, were nevertheless recognized. The exploit
was so well bruited abroad that the senior member
of the firm, who had been a friend as well as a
partner of his father’s, had given him what the
old gentleman was pleased to term a “remonstrance,”
and what he himself denominated a
“blistering.” “Mark my words,” had been its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
conclusion, “that fellow Grayson will ruin you.”
Was it possible that this prophet of evil would
fail to note the fulfillment of the prognostication?
Would this event give no color to the supposition
that he had been gambling with the money, that
Grayson had won it, and then was drowned and
robbed?</p>

<p>Oh, why, why had he so struggled to save his
wretched life? The terrors of the water no longer
shook his nerves. As he noted the trembling of
the little craft,—the flimsiest thing, he thought,
that he had ever seen afloat,—he said to himself
that it would be the luckiest chance that had ever
befallen him should the flatboat suddenly disintegrate,
timber from timber, on the swelling centre
of the tide, engulfing him never to rise again. “I
would not move a hand to save my life. I wish I
were dead,” he said, his white face turned to the
wall. “I wish I were dead.” And then he realized
that he had his wish. He was dead.</p>

<p>For the flatboatmen were talking again, with a
morbid revolving around the subject. From their
disjointed dialogue it appeared that the “stiff”
was not on the sand-bar now; it had been removed
in obedience to a telegram from a firm in St. Louis,—Greenhalge,
Gould &amp; Fife, cotton commission
merchants. One of their clerks had come down
by train on the other side of the river, “nigh tore
up” about the belt and the loss of the money.
He recognized the dead man by his clothes, and
the color of his hair and eyes,—“there was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
other way to know him, he was such a s’prisin’
bruised-up sight.” This clerk had once given the
man a meerschaum pipe that was in the breast-pocket
yet, and some papers were dried off, and
read and identified. He was shipped by train.
They would bury him where he came from. The
firm and its employees would turn out, probably,
and do the handsome thing. “Good for trade, I
reckon,” remarked the proprietor of the flatboat
store, with an appreciation of sentiment as an
agent of profit.</p>

<p>“What’s the man’s name?” demanded the
other.</p>

<p>“He never left no name as I heard. He loafed
round Kyarter’s sto’ over thar in the bend awhile,
an’ a nigger rowed him over in a dug-out to see
the stiff, an’ he give his orders an’ put out fur the
up-country quick.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t talkin’ ’bout <i>him</i>. I mean the stiff.
What was the stiff’s name?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Royce. Lucien Royce,—that’s the stiff’s
name. Lucien Leonard Royce.”</p>

<p>And thus it was that the juggler realized that
he was dead.</p>

<p>He made haste to leave the trading-boat as soon
as he could stand, however unsteadily, on his feet.
And the boatmen were not ill pleased to see him
go. The humane search for all survivors of the
wreck and the rescue of the bodies had been in
progress for some days, but with a vague terror of
implication in crime which must indeed be appalling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
to the poor, who believe that justice is meted
out according to the price the victim can pay for
it, the flatboatmen were drifting night and day
further and further away from the dreaded locality.
When they had chanced to meet the skiffs
sent out by the search-parties for victims of the
disaster, they had said naught of the man whom
they had rescued, who lay between life and death
in the bunk. They had even relinquished the opportunity
of “scrapping” about the waters for
floating articles, of scant value in themselves,
hardly worth the gathering of them together by
the owners, but precious indeed to those of so restricted
opportunities,—tins of edibles, cutlery,
bedding, cooking utensils, bits of furniture, table-ware,
garments, and the like. Once a stranger
had boarded the craft, but he came no further
than the door of the store, where he was furnished
with a flask of whiskey needed for a half-drowned
man lying hard by on a sand-bar. So when their
guest was at last on his feet again they bade him
farewell with a right good will, and the trifle of
change that was in the pocket of poor John Grayson’s
knickerbockers was a superfluity to their
satisfaction.</p>

<p>They set Royce ashore one night at a point
which they stated was half a mile from the railroad;
it seemed a league or more through the
dense oak forests, clear of undergrowth, level as
a park, before he sighted a red lantern and an
empty box car on a siding near a great tank.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
There was apparently not another soul in the
world, so unutterably lonely was the spot. He
clambered into the car, knowing that he could not
well play the rôle of tramp on any discerning
train-man while wearing Grayson’s expensive russet
shoes, albeit somewhat the worse for water,
and his natty knickerbockers and blazer. He
would invent some story and beg a ride. He
lay down behind a pile of bagging, and when he
awoke he saw that the car was moving rapidly,
that it was half full of freight, that an afternoon
sun was streaming in dusty bars through the
chinks in the door, that he must have traversed
many a mile of the inland country from the scene
of the disaster; so many miles that, the next
morning, when the car was opened in the yard of
the freight depot of a small town, the whole landscape
was as strange to him as if he had entered
a new world. Great purple mountains, wooded
to their crests, encircled the horizon, itself seeming
lifted to a great height, in contrast with the
low-lying skies of the swamp country; and now
and again, where the summit-lines were broken
by gaps, further visions of enchanted heights in
ethereal tints of blue and alluring sun-flooded
slopes met his gaze. There was a river, too, narrow,
smoothly flowing, but cliff-bound, crystal-clear
in a rocky channel that curved between the
mountains it reflected. The sunshine was so dazzling
that he made scant shift to see the men, who,
in moving the freight, discovered him. The first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
demonstration of the yardmaster was wrathful
bluster because of the impudent device of the supposed
tramp and his success in stealing a ride.
But as Lucien Royce rose to his feet, and his costume
that of a young gentleman of bucolic proclivities
taking his ease and dispensing with ceremony,
became visible, he was received with banter and
laughter. He was presumed to be engaged in
some kind of adolescent escapade,—stealing a
ride for a wager, perhaps; and as, with his quick
intelligence, he perceived this fact, he answered
in the same vein. He leaped out of the car, made
his way from the yard and up the main street of
the town, and when, reaching its opposite extremity,
he was out in the country, he walked as if for
his life. All day long he trudged at the top of
his speed. Pedestrianism had been one of his
many fads, and he wished more than once for his
pedometer, that he might have his score to boast
of and break the record of the pedestrian club
of which he was an active member; and then he
would check himself suddenly, remembering that
it was decreed that he should never see his old
comrades again. He was dead! His safety imperatively
required that he should remain dead.</p>

<p>Apparently he left the sunshine behind him;
the wind flagged and fell back; only certain clouds
maintained an equal pace, congregating about the
summits of the mountains, showing tier on tier
above them, so darkly purple that sometimes he
could hardly tell which was shadowy earth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
which over-shadowing sky. Always, as he clambered
over the flank of some great ridge and
looked upon the deep dells of the valley, these
clouds were already crossing it, and rising, peak
on peak and towering height over height, above
the crest of the mountains still beyond. In one
of these sequestered nooks among the vast ranges,
when the swift lightnings were unleashed and the
thunder reverberated from dome to dome and the
weighty rain fell in tumultuous torrents, he dragged
his stumbling feet to a lighted window dimly flickering
in the gloom, and found the latch-string of
Tubal Cain Sims’s door on the outside, as the hospitable
mistress of the cabin said it always should
be, when she welcomed the wayfarer.</p>

<p>And thus it came to pass that within a fortnight
after the disaster the juggler sat listening to the
miller’s daughter as she read the account of the
terrible death of young Lucien Royce. He could
have given the journalist many points on the details
of the accident. But his mind ceased its
retrospection, and he hearkened with keen interest,
for one so very dead, to the narrative of the supplemental
events occurring in the city of his home.
As Euphemia droned drearily on, he gathered that
the firm had made an assignment, the result of the
loss of the funds of which Lucien Royce had been
robbed, and their consequent inability to take up
their paper. The amount was stated at thrice the
reality, and his lips curved with a scornful wonder
as to whether this was a commercial device<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
to render the failure more seemly and respectable,
or was merely due to the magnifying proclivities
natural to the race of reporters. “It lets the
house down easier,—that’s one good thing,” he
reflected. And then he checked himself, marveling
if other people who were dead could not immediately
dissever their interests and affections from
those subjects and associations that had once enthralled
them. “It must take a long time to get
thoroughly acclimated to another world,” he
thought, realizing that the impulse of satisfaction
which he had experienced because the “break”
had its justification in the eyes of the commercial
world was the loyal sentiment to the firm shared
by every man on their pay-roll. “We could have
weathered the flurry easily enough but for this,”
he knew the various employees were all severally
saying to their personal friends and such of the
general public as came within their opportunity.
It seems that cynicism is not a growth exclusively
native to this sphere, for he presently found himself
attributing to a wish to fix general attention
on this subject of the loss of the money the firm’s
elaborate attention to the details of the obsequies
of their unfortunate employee. But they would
not overdo it, he realized even before Euphemia,
hobbling painfully among words whose existence
had hitherto been undreamed-of by her, and
whose structure would serve to render them obsolete
forever in her vocabulary after this single
usage, had reached the description of the funeral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
arrangements. He had feared she would flag, and
would thus balk his palpitating curiosity; but the
mournful pageantry of death has its fascination
for certain temperaments, and it is fair to say she
would not have read so long, nor would Tubal
Sims and his wife have waking listened, had the
theme been more cheerful.</p>

<p>No, the firm would not overdo it. They were
men of good taste and acumen. The public received
sundry reminders that Lucien Royce’s deceased
father had been a member of the firm for
many years, and much of the quondam prosperity
had been due to his sagacity and sterling qualities.
The young man’s inherited interest in the
business was of course swamped with the rest.
And all this made the presence of each of the
partners and of all the employees, together with
large and showy floral tributes at St. —— Church,
the more appropriate and natural. As no simple
interment could have done, however, it had also
riveted attention on that especial feature, the loss
of the money, which was in itself calculated to
excite much sympathy and commiseration in the
commercial heart, and to be of service in securing
a composition with creditors and the possibility of
continuance.</p>

<p>“They needn’t have been so mighty particular,”
he said to himself a moment afterward, his eyes
bright and shining, the color in his cheeks. “I
could have gotten up a big enough blow-out all by
myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>For that meed of popularity which many better
men never achieve had been a gratuitous gift to
Lucien Royce, who had never done aught to secure
it or given it a thought in his life. His gay young
friends were bereaved. All experiencing a sense
of personal loss, all struck aghast with dismay and
pity, those attended in a body who were of his
many clubs and societies, and others singly if they
happened to be merely friends outside the bonds
of fraternities. The church was densely thronged;
a wealth of flowers filled the chancel. The words
of a popular hymn were sung by a member of the
Echo Quartet, a singer of local renown, to an air
composed by the late Lucien Royce,—so pathetic,
with such sudden minor transitions, such dying
falls (it had been a love-song, and he had written
the words as well as the music), that the congregation
were in tears as they listened.</p>

<p>“Ah ha, my fine first tenor!” the juggler said
to himself in prideful triumph at the praise of
print. “And how about that final phrase of each
refrain that you persisted ought to resolve itself
into the major, and not the minor chord? Oh,
oh! Mightily pleased to stand up before a big
crowd and sing it now, for all its faulty harmony!”</p>

<p>But if he had already been gratified, he was
shortly delighted. The account digressed to the
personal qualities of the deceased, his exceptional
popularity, the high esteem in which he was held
by his business associates, the great affection which
his personal friends entertained for him, the extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
versatility of his talents. He was a
wonderful athlete for an amateur. (The juggler
listened with a critical jealous ear to the detail of
certain feats of lifting, walking, and swimming.
“I can break that record now,” he muttered.) He
was a very acceptable amateur actor. He sang
delightfully, and composed charming songs with
words of considerable merit; in fact, he had a gift
of light, easy versification. He was hospitable
and joyous, and fond of entertaining his friends,
to whom he was much attached,—the more as he
was so alone in the world, having no near kindred
since the death of his father. There was no bitterness
in his mirth; he laughed with you rather than
at you. (“Don’t be too sure of that,” said the
juggler, in his sleeve.) He was wonderfully quick
in learning, even quick in acquiring any mechanical
art that struck his attention. He had really
become a skillful prestidigitator (how the juggler
blessed the six-pronged unpronounceable word as
Euphemia struggled to take hold of it, and finally
left it as incomprehensible!): and this came about
partly through his extraordinary quickness, and
partly because no one could resist his fascinating
<i>bonhomie</i>, and many a traveling artist in legerdemain
had imparted his professional secrets to him
from sheer good will and liking. He was the
same to all classes; he had an easy capacity for
adapting himself to the company he was in for
the time being, as if it were his choice. Many a
pleasant haunt of his friends would lack its relish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
after this, and it would be long before the name
or face of Lucien Royce would be forgotten in St.
Louis city.</p>

<p>“Well,” mused the juggler, with a sigh, as the
reading concluded, “it’s worth dying once in a
while, to get a send-off like that.”</p>

<p>“Pore young man!” ejaculated Mrs. Sims,
looking up with a sigh too, the relief from the
long tension, her big creased solemn face bereft of
every dimple.</p>

<p>The juggler caught himself hastily. “The paper
doesn’t say what Sabbath-school he was a member
of,” he observed, with mock seriousness.</p>

<p>“That’s a fac’,” returned Euphemia, unfolding
the upper part of the journal to reperuse with a
searching eye the portion relating to biographical
detail. After an interval of vain scrutiny she remarked,
“Nor it don’t say nuther whether he war
a member o’ the Hard-Shell Baptis’ or Missionary
or Methody.”</p>

<p>“He mought be a sinner, an’ the paper don’t
like ter say it, him bein’ dead,” wheezed Mrs.
Sims lugubriously, intuitively seizing upon a salient
point of polite modern journalism. The anxious
speculation in her fat overclouded countenance was
painful to see, for Mrs. Sims believed in a material
hell with a plenitude of brimstone and blue
blazes.</p>

<p>“I dare say he <i>was</i> a sinner!” exclaimed the
juggler, with his manner of half-mocking banter.
“Poor Lucien Royce!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>Only late that night, when all the house was
still, and darkness was among the sombre mountains,
and the absolute negation of vision seemed
to nullify all the world, did his mood change. He
lay staring with unseeing eyes into the void gloom
about him, yet beholding with a faculty more potent
than sight the decorated chancel, the clergyman
in his surplice, the crowds of sympathetic
faces, the casket with the funeral wreaths covering
it,—the hideous mockery that it all was, the terrible
hoax!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> juggler was hardly disposed to felicitate
himself upon this feat of simulation which had
served to deceive the whole of his native city, and
to bury a stranger, as it were, in his own grave.
He began to pity the plight of the dead if they
could so yearningly remember the life they had
left. Return for him was impossible. Glimpses
of the moon might shadow forth spirits revenant,
but for him memory only must serve. He wondered
that he could not accept conclusions so evidently
final, for over and again, in the deep
watches of the night, he would argue anew within
himself the chances <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> of transforming
these immutable fictions into fact, of overcoming
the appearance of crime by his previous high character,
of relying on the good feeling of the firm,
and the futility of the proceeding, to save him
from prosecution. Then always, when he would
reach this point, and his heart would begin to beat
fast with the hope of restoration to life, it would
stand still with a sudden paralysis and sink like
lead; for there were interests other than those of
revenge or justice, or preserving the public morals
by enforcing penalties for the infringement of the
law to be served by his incarceration in a good
strong safe prison. There existed a certain corporation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the Gerault Bonley Marble Company,
that he knew would give much money to be able
to lay hands upon him now, and that had doubtless
grieved for his demise like unto Rachel mourning
for her children. The Gerault Bonley Marble
Company had, in the past few years, been greatly
enriched by the discovery of beds of a very fine marble
in a large body of Tennessee land, in which,
however, they merely held an estate <i>per autre vie</i>,—limited
to the duration of Lucien Royce’s natural
existence. In this unique position of a <i>cestui que
vie</i> he had at first felt a certain glow of pride. It
was characteristic of his knack of achieving importance
and prominence with so slight effort that he
seemed, as it were, born to a certain preëminence.
He recollected the prestige it added to his personality
at the time when it was discovered that there
were great beds of marble in the almost worthless
tract, and the sensation of pleased notoriety he
had experienced when Mr. Gerault Bonley, the
president of the company, a well-known broker,
had dropped in at the office to look at him—he
had never taken the trouble before—and have a
word with him. “Remember your business is to
<i>live</i>, young man,” he had said in leaving, flushed
and elated with success. “That’s all you have to
do. And if you ever find any hitch about doing
it pleasantly, come to us, and we will help you eke
it out. You are the one who lives, you understand.”
And he walked out, portly and rubicund,
his eye kindling as he went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>Lucien Royce had ridden up town on the cable
car one evening, a day or two afterward, and he
had noticed with new interest a man, forlorn,
shabby, chewing the end of a five-cent cigar so
hard between his teeth as he talked that he was
unaware that its light had died out, who railed at
life and his luck in unmeasured terms that astonished
the passengers precariously perched on the
platform of the rear car. This was the unsuccessful
speculator who, some years earlier, had sought
to mortgage the land in question to Mr. Gerault
Bonley, the broker, who had bought up his paper
and was disposed toward thumbscrews. It was
not a good day for mortgages, somehow, but, with
the desperation of a man already pressed to the
wall, about as badly broken as he was likely to be,
the debtor would not consent to an absolute transfer
of the title.</p>

<p>“The land will be sold under execution, then,”
he of the thumbscrews had said.</p>

<p>“The law allows two years for redemption, in
Tennessee,” the owner had retorted, with the expectation
of better times in his face.</p>

<p>Perhaps because of the resistance,—the broker
always said he did not know why he had wanted
the land, for although he was aware that a little
marble quarry had once been worked there, it had
been abandoned as not worth the labor,—still
protesting that he could not avail himself of the
property unless for a term of years, at least, he
finally offered the bait of enough ready money to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
extricate the speculator, and give him another
show amongst the bulls and bears, and the conveyance
was made for the uncertain term of the life
of another. Lucien Royce had chanced to drop
in on some business for Greenhalge, Gould &amp;
Fife, the cotton commission firm, a lithe, muscular
young fellow, the ideal of an athlete, and the
thought suggested itself to the broker that the
estate should be limited to the duration of his life.
The proposition was carelessly acceded to by the
young man, attracted for the moment by the novelty
of the proceeding, apprehending in the matter
the merest formality. This was the conclusion.</p>

<p>“And now you’ll live forever!” cried the disappointed
speculator, suddenly recognizing, in the
uncertain light on the platform of the car, the
features of the stalwart <i>cestui que vie</i>. Once more
he was chewing hard on his cigar, once more inveighing
against his accursed luck, as he stretched
the newspaper toward the dull lamp of the car, indicating
with a trembling hand the big head-lines
chronicling the discovery, while the cumbrous
vehicle went gliding along through the blue haze
of the dusk and the smoke and the dust,—the
medium through which the looming blocks of buildings
and the long double file of electric lights were
visible down the avenue. “You’ll live forever,
while those men make millions on the tract they
euchred me out of at ten dollars an acre! It
would be a charity for you to fall off the car and
break your backbone. They tell me concussion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
the brain is painless. I’ll swear I’d feel justified
if I should hide in a dark alley, some night, and
garrote you as you go by to the club.”</p>

<p>“There’s another case of garroting in the
paper,” observed a mutual acquaintance by way
of diversion.</p>

<p>“I noticed it. That’s what reminded me of it.
It’s like lassoing. I lived a long time in Texas,”
he said, as he swung himself off at a side-street,
and disappeared in the closing haze that baffled
the incandescent lights showing upon its density
in yellow blurs without illuminating it.</p>

<p>“You’d better look out for that man, sure
enough,” the literal-minded mutual acquaintance
warned Lucien Royce. “He feels mighty sore.
This company is going to make ‘big money’ on
his land.”</p>

<p>But Royce laughed it off. “I am the one who
lives,” he boasted.</p>

<p>He found it not altogether so careless an existence
since it was worth so much financially. His
acute sensibilities realized a sort of espionage before
he was definitely aware of it. He came to
know that he was reckoned up. What he did,
where he went, how he felt, were matters in which
other people were concerning themselves. He
resented the irksome experience as an attack on
his liberty. He felt no longer a free man. And
this impression grew as the yield from the property
promised more and more. The Bonley Company
had gone to heavy expenses. They had put in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
costly machinery. They had hired gangs and
gangs of men. They had built miles of narrow-gauge
railroad, to convey the stone by land as well
as by water. It had become a gigantic venture.
The jocose “Take care!” “Live for <i>my</i> sake!”
“Be good to yourself!” which had at first formed
the staple of the injunctions to him when he
chanced to encounter any member of the company,
changed to serious solicitous inquiry which affronted
him. More than once Mr. Bonley called upon him
to remonstrate about late hours, heavy suppers,
and the disastrous effects upon the constitution of
drinking wine and strong waters. Thus the rubicund
Mr. Gerault Bonley, whose countenance was
brilliant with the glow of old Rye! In one instance,
when Royce’s somewhat cavalier and scornful
reception of these kind attentions served to
rouse Mr. Bonley to the realization that the <i>cestui
que vie</i> claimed the right to have other objects in
existence than merely to live for the corporation’s
sake, the president of the company apologized, but
urged him to consider, for the justification of this
anxiety, what large financial interests and liabilities
hung upon the thread of his life. There was
a panic among the company whenever he went to
the seashore for a short vacation, and once he
allowed himself to be persuaded out of a trip to
Europe, of which acquiescence he was afterward
ashamed,—so much so that when a place in the
office of the Bonley Company was offered him,
with a large increase of salary, but with the unavowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
purpose of keeping him under surveillance,
that he might always be at hand and easily reckoned
up, he declined it with such peremptoriness
as to cause the company to relax this unwise exhibition
of solicitude for the time, and greatly to
please his own firm, Greenhalge, Gould &amp; Fife,
who had not relished the effort to decoy a confidential
clerk from their employ. On one occasion
when, in training for a boat-race, he was suddenly
prostrated by the heat, the anxiety of the Gerault
Bonley Marble Company knew no bounds, and its
manifestation more than verged upon the ridiculous;
it was the joke of the whole town. The
claims of his own personal friends—he had no
near relatives—were set at naught. The company
took possession of him. He came to himself
in one of the well-appointed guest-chambers of
Mr. Bonley’s own house; and when he rallied,
which he did almost immediately, with the recuperative
powers of youth and his great strength, he
was detained there several days longer than was
necessary by his host’s insistence, until indeed the
physician in charge laughed in the face of Mr.
Gerault Bonley, the broker.</p>

<p>“Take care you don’t do anything eccentric,”
the doctor said in parting at last from his patient.
“That company might shut you up in a lunatic
asylum or a sanitarium, where you would be ready
for inspection at all hours,—just to make sure
you are alive, you see.”</p>

<p>It was meant for a joke, but it grated on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
nerves of the <i>cestui que vie</i>. And now it came
back as he lay under the dark roof of Tubal Cain
Sims’s house, staring into the unresponsive night,
with the thought that a good strong state prison
would serve the purpose of the Marble Company,
looking toward his safekeeping, more effectually
still. He could well understand their despair
upon the supposed determination of the life estate,
for since they had secured the land at slight cost,
the vast profits of the industry were to the ordinary
business mind all the dearer, being the favor, as
it were, of chance, or the uncovenanted mercy of
Providence,—“clean make.” How could they
survive the reversion of the property, with all its
present wealth and its future prospects, to the
original grantor? His imagination, alert as it
was, failed to respond to so heavy a demand upon
its resources. Should they find that the death of
the <i>cestui que vie</i> was spurious, their tenancy not
yet expired, should they be restored to their former
status, what a warning this untoward alarm would
seem, what restraints upon his liberty might not
be attempted! The idea bereft him of his last
hope. Could he reasonably expect to escape prosecution
when his custody in the clutches of the law
was so obviously to the interests of a powerful
corporation like this? Even if his own firm of
Greenhalge, Gould &amp; Fife should be averse to it
to avenge their losses, what powerful influence
would be brought to bear upon them by the
Gerault Bonley Marble Company; what substantial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
values were to be dangled before the eyes of a
broken firm in the friendship and backing of a
strong financial association like this! The Marble
Company would move heaven and earth to
place him behind the bars. There could Mr.
Bonley come and look at him any fine day, as he
sat making shoes and saddles,—he had heard that
at the penitentiary they put their swell guests to
such occupations, and his deft fingers might commend
their utility in this service to the commonwealth,—or
perhaps busied in some clerical capacity
to which his long experience in counting-rooms
rendered him apt. Mr. Bonley’s scarlet countenance
and bristly white mustache were of a calmer
aspect as they appeared in this vision than they
had worn in reality for many a long day! The
menu would contain naught to destroy the digestion
of the <i>cestui que vie</i> or affright the Marble
Company in the way of midnight suppers and unlimited
champagne. There would be no wild uproarious
companions, no gambling escapades, no
perilous activities on the horizontal bar,—what
war had Mr. Bonley waged against his attachment
to the gymnasium!—no swimming-matches, no
boat-races, no encounters with gloves or foils.
Truly Mr. Bonley’s estate would be gracious
indeed!</p>

<p>No; Lucien Royce felt that his escape was a
crowning mercy vouchsafed. His most imperative
care should be to make it good, or he might well
spend a decade of the best years of his life behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
the bars for a crime he had not committed. His
incarceration would easily be compassed, were his
defense far more complete than perverse circumstance
rendered possible, by the craft and persistence
of men who had such large interests at stake
on the life and well-being of a wild, adventurous,
hairbrained boy. His supposititious death had
saved his name, his commercial honor, which he
held dear. John Grayson, with the theft of the
belt and its treasure, had also taken his life—for
he had no life left! He was dead! He was
very dead! And let the Gerault Bonley Marble
Company mourn him. With a laughing sneer
on his face, he cursed again, as he had cursed a
thousand times, the plastic folly, or the vagary
of chance, or whatever fate it was that induced
him to lend himself to the broker’s scheme; for
although he had thought it a mere formality, it
had in effect sold him into a species of slavery for
the rest of his natural life. “But is not my advice
good advice?” Mr. Bonley had more than once
urged upon his recalcitrant mood. “Is it not in
your <i>own</i> interests as well as in ours? Is it not
exactly the advice I would give to my own son?”</p>

<p>“He needs it. Give it to <i>him</i>,” the <i>cestui que
vie</i> would reply in flippant despair. But Mr.
Bonley’s son was not worth so much money to the
company, and he went his own ways with some
celerity, all unchecked.</p>

<p>The continually administered cautions, the sense
of sustaining anxiety, espionage, criticism, of thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
sharing his life, had made it in some sort a burden
to the merry <i>cestui que vie</i>; and therefore, in the
first days of his escape, the realization of the petty
persecutions, the irksome advice of the ill-advised
Mr. Bonley, shaken off and forever thwarted,
seemed to the young man only matter for self-gratulation.
In the accumulation of these trifles
in his thoughts, he had lost sight of the far-reaching
significance of the event until he had reached
the haven of Etowah Cove, and his bodily fatigue
and distress of mind were somewhat allayed. Then
he began to perceive that in this fictitious death
a great property had changed hands, a definite
right was subverted; a terrible fraud had been
practiced on the tenants <i>per autre vie</i>, in that the
life estate was not yet terminated. Mr. Gerault
Bonley was mulcted of his prominence as a ludicrous,
pertinacious, troublous bore, and the personality
of the company was asserted as possessors
of certain rights and large interests of which they
were to be bereft through his agency. He was
offered his choice,—to stay dead, or to go back
and serve a term in the penitentiary for a crime
he had never committed, to benefit the financial
interests of Mr. Gerault Bonley and his associates.
He sought now and again some solace in reflecting
upon the hard bargain that Mr. Bonley had driven
with the original owner, the poetic justice that his
lands should revert to him in his lifetime, their
value enhanced a thousandfold by their own inherent
natural wealth, which had been merely developed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
not bestowed, by the Marble Company. “I
have made one poor soul happy, anyhow! It’s
just as well that he should get the land before they
have sold and shipped all the rock in it. He
would have nothing left except a hole in the ground
but for this,” he muttered to his pillow. For the
Marble Company had been exempted by the terms
of the grant from “any impeachment of waste,”
and had successfully defended a suit brought by
the reversioner, who sought to restrain their operations
by showing that not even the surface of his
tract would be left to him upon the determination of
the estate <i>per autre vie</i>. “He never seemed to have
any grudge against me, and I can’t say I blame him
for being glad I am dead,” said Royce, seeking to
gauge the sentiments of the joyful reversioner.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, all his commercial instincts revolted.
They would not support this arbitrary
dispensing of justice. The Gerault Bonley Marble
Company’s right was definite and indefeasible,
and unlawfully he had divested them of it. The
idea was abhorrent to his commercial conscience.
All the depth of character which he possessed lay in
this endowment. He had no religious convictions,
no spiritual estimate of the abstractions of right
and wrong. To him the thought of religion was
like a capitulation. It had never occurred to him
as a thing to live by. It seemed of the nature of
mortuaries, akin to last wills and testaments, of
the very essence of finality. His moral structure
was the creation of correct commercial principles,—sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
enough, but limited. It was an impenetrable
external shell, at once an asset, a protection,
and a virtue, but it had no intimate inner tissues.
His soul languished inert within it. As far as
his financial integrity was concerned, there had
been no leanings to the wrong, no struggles against
temptation, not even temptation; he was proof
against it. His integrity diminished even his capacity
for repentance. He had never felt himself
a sinner. On the contrary, he thought he had
done mighty well. He had been for years in touch
with the markets at home and abroad, but he could
quote no spiritual values. For the first time in
his life, he groped for a knowledge of the right,
he strove with the definite sense of wrong-doing.
His supposed death had all the taint of dishonor;
it affected him as a false entry might have done.
The indirect good that it wrought, the natural
justice that it meted out, appealed to him no more
than the success of speculating with the funds of
the firm that employed him might serve to commend
this peculation to his incorruptible commercial
honor.</p>

<p>He fared better when he sought to protest an
irresponsibility. It was the Marble Company’s
affair to disprove his death if they could, to maintain
themselves in continual assurance of his life.
“I’ve seen old Bonley perform so long like a hen
with one chicken that I imitate him instinctively.
I assume a sort of guardianship of the Gerault
Bonley Marble Company as they assumed it of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
me, and one is as absurd as the other. The company’s
counsel ought to be equal to the situation.
I have nothing to do with them. Their property
is held for a term of years, which happens to be
the duration of my life. I take on as if a <i>cestui
que vie</i> was a salaried officer of the Bonley Company,—as
if I were paid for drawing the breath
of life. It is no part of my duty to report continually
for observation. I forfeit no pledge. I
violate no trust. And self-preservation is the first
law of nature.”</p>

<p>With these vacillations he had struggled in
throes of mental agony as he lay on the ledges of
the rocks above the river and affected to angle;
or as he wandered alone through the woods; or
when he sat, unheeding the drawling talk of his
host, in the open passage where they lighted their
pipes together, his evident preoccupation shrewdly
noted by the suspicious mountaineer; or, more
than all, in the silent watches of the night, before
physical fatigue could coerce sleep to his aid,—always
arguing the wrong that his silence and
absence wrought to others, yet the false suspicion
on the part of Greenhalge, Gould &amp; Fife, and
the consequent terrible fate that his return would
bring upon himself; the intrinsic justice in the
restoration to the reversioner of his plundered
lands, and yet the positive legal rights which the
Gerault Bonley Marble Company held in their unexpired
tenancy <i>per autre vie</i>; the lies that thus
conspired in their masquerade as truth, yet the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
fact that the truth unmasked would prove the
falsest of them all. He had never in all the exercitations
of his various problems seemed so near
a definite and final decision as now. Never had
he reverted so often to one basis of action. He
determined that he would not return to the certainty
of an ignominious imprisonment on a false
suspicion for the sole benefit of a strong corporation
of financial sharks, who, on the pretext of a
tenancy <i>per autre vie</i>, were tearing the estate of
their grantor from off the face of the earth; the
reversioner would have nothing left but literally
a hole in the ground! This awful sacrificial surrender
would serve no moral right, but one of
those legalized robberies which arise from a fault
of the law through its constitutional deficiencies,
being at last only of human device. And if, he
argued, it was not his function to remodel the
laws, and administer them according to the moral
basis of evident right, it was in this instance his
privilege to dispense even-handed justice.</p>

<p>But when he fell asleep, and his will lay dormant,
and his reasoning faculties were blunted,
and only his conscience vaguely throbbed with an
unassuaged wound, the sense of the commercial
wrong that he did, the realization of the definite
legal right that he extinguished, the weight of responsibility
with which his mere breathing the
breath of life had burdened him, all were reasserted
without the connivance of volition, and over
and over again that poignant cry, “But the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
who lives—the one for whose life—his life—his
life—his life!” rang through the house with all
the pent-up agony of his days of doubt and strivings
and distress in its tone.</p>

<p>It was a silent house. No wind stirred. Not
a leaf rustled. One might hear the ash crumble
covering the embers on the hearth. A vague monotone
came from the river. Outside, the still
radiance of a late-risen moon lay pallid and lonely
on the newly ploughed fields. Here and there
crevices in the chinking between the logs of the
walls made shift to admit a ray, sending its slight
shaft through the brown gloom of the interior,
visible itself and luminous in its filar tenuity, yet
dispensing no light. One of these rays glimmered
through the clapboards of the roof on the face of
the sleeper, which showed in the dusk, with all its
wan trouble on it, with the distinctness of some
sharply cut cameo, to Tubal Cain Sims, who, half
dressed and with shock head and bare feet, had
climbed the stair, and lurked there listening, that
perchance he might hear more to convey to the
sharp-set curiosity of the magisterial lime-burner.</p>

<p>This involuntary lapse of his resolution left no
trace on the juggler’s consciousness when he awoke
the next morning. He was not aware that he had
dreamed, that in sleeping he had swerved from his
intention, far less that he had cried out in his unrealized
mental anguish. He took comfort from
his stanch mental poise. The fact that he held
fast to his conclusion seemed to confirm the validity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
of his judgment. Here he was to begin life
anew, and it behooved him to make the most and
the best of it. For one moment the recollection
of the world he had left almost overcame him,—the
contrast it bore to his sorry future! Even its
workaday aspect,—the office, his high desk by
the window, the thunder of the cotton-laden wagons
in the streets and the clamor of voices impinging
so slightly on his absorption in his work as to
be ignored,—even this wrung a pang from him
now. How much more the thought of the club,
with its brilliant lights, and its luxury of furnishing,
and its delectable cuisine, and the pretensions
of its elder members, and the countenance they
were pleased to show him; of the fraternity halls
where he was so prime a favorite; of the gymnasium
he affected, and the boating and swimming
clubs; of his choice social circle, with its germans
and musicales, its little dinners and tally-ho drives,
its private theatricals, its decorous parlors of refined
and elegant suggestions, of which he valued
the <i>entrée</i> in proportion as he had once felt it
jeopardized by the bruiting abroad of that wild
gambling escapade, which he feared, in the estimation
of the severe and straight-laced matrons and
delicate-minded young girls, ill became a member
of so elevated a coterie. They seemed, in his
recollection, of an embellished beauty and aloof
majesty infinitely removed from his sordid plight
and maimed estate. He faltered as he thought of
his hopeless alienation from it all, his dreary exile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>And then, with a sudden bracing of the nerves,
he reflected on the view which this refined society
would entertain of the alternative that fate presented;
the disgrace which he would sustain in his
return was hardly to be mentioned to ears so polite!
Was he farther from his friends here than
he would be there? Was he more definitely banished
from his wonted sphere? He was dead to
them,—forever dead,—and the sooner forgotten
the better!</p>

<p>In pursuance of his determination, he went
downstairs arrayed in the blue-checked homespun
shirt and gray jeans trousers which Mrs. Sims
with so great and dilatory labor had contrived.
He thought he looked the typical mountaineer in
this attire, with a pair of long cowhide boots, purchased
at the cross-roads store, drawn up to his
knees over the legs of the trousers, and a white
wool hat of broad brim set far back on his dark
red-brown hair. He could hardly have deceived
even an unpracticed eye. The texture of his skin,
shielded by his vocation from wind and weather;
the careful grooming which was the habit of years;
the trained step and pose and manner, unconscious
though they were; the hand, delicate, however
muscular, and white, and with well-tended nails;
the silken quality of his smooth hair and mustache;
the expression of the eye;—he looked like a young
“society swell” dressed for a rural rôle in private
theatricals.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sims, who was languidly setting the table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
in the passage, while Euphemia, clashing the pots
and pans and kettles in the room to the left, was
“dishin’ up” breakfast, paused in her wheezing
hymn, catching sight of him, to survey her handiwork.</p>

<p>“Waal!” she exclaimed in delighted pride, appropriating
to her own skill the credit of the effect
of his symmetry. “Now don’t them clothes jes’
set! I’ll be boun’ nobody kin say ez I ain’t a
plumb special hand fur the needle an’ shears! I
jes’ want Tubal Cain Sims ter view them ‘vain
trappin’s,’ ez the hyme calls ’em,—though ez we
ain’t endowed by Providence with feathers, thar
ain’t no use in makin’ a sin out’n hevin’ the bes’
clothes what we kin git.”</p>

<p>The juggler was as vain as a young man can
well be. But he had seldom encountered such
outspoken admiration, and was a trifle out of
countenance; for what Mrs. Sims conceived to be
the excellence of her own proficiency as a tailor
he apprehended was due to the graces of his personal
endowment. He made her a flourishing bow
of mock courtesy, and then stood leaning against
the jamb of the door, one hand in the pocket of
the gray trousers, the other readjusting the wide
low shirt-collar about his throat.</p>

<p>“I’d like ter know what Tubal Cain Sims <i>will</i>
say now!” exclaimed Mrs. Sims, pursuing corollaries
of the main proposition of triumph. “He
’lows, whenst I make him ennythin’ ter wear, ez
he kin sca’cely find his way inter sech shapen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
gear. An’ whenst in ’em, he ’lows he’ll never
git out no mo’, an’ air clad in his grave-clothes—goin’
’bout workin’ an’ sech—in his grave-clothes!
It’s a plumb sin, the way he talks!”</p>

<p>Her face clouded for an instant, remembering
the ungrateful flouts; then as her gaze returned to
her guest, she dimpled anew.</p>

<p>“But laws-a-massy!” she cried, “how peart ye
do ’pear in them clothes, to be sure! A heap
more like sure enough folks than in them comical
little pantees ye hev been a-wearin’.”</p>

<p>He could not forbear a laugh at her criticism of
the spruce knickerbockers; but with the thought
of the varying standards of a different status of
life the realization of his exile came to him anew,
and imbittered the decoction called coffee which
Mrs. Sims handed to him, and although his eyes
were dry, as he gulped it down, he tasted tears.</p>

<p>It was difficult for him to resent any admiration
of himself as too redundant, but she could not quit
the subject, and pointed out to Tubal Cain Sims,
when he entered, the excellence of the fit of the
shirt about the shoulders and its flatness in the
back; apparently arguing that if this shirt fitted
the juggler, it was only Tubal Cain Sims’s rugged
temper and finical fancy that <i>his</i> shirt did not fit.
The old man’s prominent shoulder-blades were not
long destined to be concealed by the worn cloth
drawn taut across their recurved arches as he
leaned slouchingly forward, and the loose amplitudes
over his narrow bent chest might well have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
been economized for a supplement across the shoulders.
It never seemed to occur to either of them
that the cloth should be cut to suit the figure, or
at all events the bearing, of the wearer. She only
tortured her helpless partner with her adherence
to a pattern at least fifty years old, and which had
fitted him well enough twenty-five years ago; but
as seam, gusset, and band burst under the stress
of his crookedness and increasing slouch, he considered
that the hand of Jane Ann Sims had utterly
forgotten its cunning, and talked as if his
clothes were a trap requiring a certain diligence
of investigation to get into, and from which there
was no escape.</p>

<p>The juggler grew restive lest Euphemia should
enter while he was a bone of contention between
the two, for Mrs. Sims was still disposed to call
on all who might behold to note the beauty of
the fit of his shirt, and Tubal Cain Sims as resolutely
refused to admire. Royce was ready to
laugh at himself that he should thus desire to shirk
these personalities in Euphemia’s presence, and
that he should assume for her a delicacy in the
discussion which he was very sure Mrs. Sims would
not appreciate. Yet he was not so coxcombical as
to preëmpt for her Mrs. Sims’s standpoint; he
realized that she might be as stolidly unadmiring
as Tubal Cain himself. He finished his breakfast
with a hasty swallow or two, and was about to
take himself off with his fishing-rod down to the
river, hearing Mrs. Sims remarking after him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
“Ye oughter thank the Lord on your bended
knees, young man, fur the fit o’ them clothes,”
and Tubal Cain Sims’s growl of objurgation that
“folks oughter have better manners an’ sense ’n
ter be thankin’ the Lord for the set o’ thar clothes
on the blessed Sabbath day.”</p>

<p>“Is this Sunday?” asked the juggler, and stood
stock-still.</p>

<p>“It air the blessed Sabbath,” said Tubal Cain,
his eyes still full of the misfit rancor and his mouth
full of corn dodger.</p>

<p>Ah, how Lucien Royce heard across the silent
Cove the bells ringing from the church towers of
St. Louis, hundreds of miles away! He distinguished
even the melody that the chimes were rippling
out,—he would have sworn to it amongst a
thousand,—and the booming of heavier metal
sounding from neighboring steeples. He knew
just how a certain dissonance impinged upon the
melodious tumult,—the bell of an old church below
Seventeenth Street that had a crack in it and
rang false. The raucous voices of newsboys were
calling the Sunday papers, much further up town
than on week-days. The clanging of the cable
cars sounded here, there, everywhere; the sunlit
streets were full of people. And then, as his
heart was throbbing near to breaking for this his
world, his home, of which he was bereft, he realized
how his imagination had cheated him. Across
the Cove the slanting sun-rays had not yet reached
the levels of the basin; the red hue of the dawning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
still tinged them. The mists of the night
clung yet in purple shadowy ravines. The dew
was in the air. Away—away—the far city of
the mirage lay sluggard and asleep. No bell rang
there save the Angelus. Now and again a figure
slipped along to early mass. The rumbling wheels
of a baker’s wagon or the tinkle of a milkman’s
bell might sound,—a phase of the town, an hour
of the day he did not know and for which he did
not care. And so he was admonished to beware
of fancies. This—<i>this</i> was his home, and here
he was to spend his life.</p>

<p>He hardly knew how he might contrive to
spend the day, he said, as he flung himself down
on a ledge of the rock overlooking the river. He
appreciated how he would value the rest, had a
week of hard work preceded it. He was no Sabbatarian
on religious principles, but adhered to the
theory as physically economical. As he lay smoking,
he argued that much of his tendency to revert
to the troubles that had whelmed him, to pine for
even the minutiæ of his old life,—aught that suggested
it was dear!—to forget that it had gone
forever and could never be conjured back, and that
a far different fate awaited him in his familiar
world, was only an indication of the morbid influence
of idleness and mental solitude. The persistence
of the activities of the human mind is but
scantily realized. Given adequate subjects to
work upon, to engross it,—a stent, so to speak,—and
its powers seem rarely greater than its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
task; but remove the objective point of occupation,
and the complications of the engine, its normal
strength yet its perilous fragility, its inherent
tendencies to dislocation, its perpetual uncontrollable
subjection to any idea, evolved at haphazard,
clutched with a tenacity as of the muscles of a galvanized
grasp, result in a chaos of disaster, the
mere contemplation of which is wonderfully conducive
to energy and the embellishment of toil.</p>

<p>Blessed are the hard workers, for their minds
and their hearts shall be sound. This truth was
most deeply felt by the young exile from the business
world as well as the world of pleasure.</p>

<p>“I must get at something,” he said to himself.
“I must realize that I am here to stay. This juggling
money”—he rattled in his pocket the silver
that he had earned the evening of his ill-starred
entertainment—“won’t last forever, even at the
rates of board and lodging in Etowah Cove. It
would be the part of wisdom to ingratiate myself
with the miller,—cross-grained old donkey,—help
him with the mill, marry the miller’s daughter,
and succeed to the throne.”</p>

<p>He laughed, with a mocking relish of the incongruity
of the idea. Then, as he thought of the
miller’s daughter, a vague perception came to him
that he had never before encountered a woman
apparently so indifferent to him; for indifference
was not the sentiment which he was wont to excite.
He remembered, too, his hasty retreat from the
table, lest her delicacy be offended if his garments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
were descanted upon in her presence. “Am I
going to persuade myself that I am in love with
this rural Napoleon in petticoats?” he asked himself
scornfully. Then he argued that it was
merely because he was not used to such critical
scrutiny of his vestments except by his tailor.
“All the same, I got out of there before the lady
Euphemia appeared.” He thus took as dispassionate
note of the fact as if he were discussing
the state of mind of another person. “I might
meet a worse fate. She could be trusted to keep
me extremely straight from now till the Judgment
Day. She is so pretty—that—if she were a trifle
softer—a trifle different, it wouldn’t be such hard
lines to make love to her.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it did not seem such “hard lines” when
she suddenly came out of the house, later in the
day; for as he glanced up the slope and beheld
her, he rose promptly and went to meet her.</p>

<p>It was a tortuous way up the slope; the outcropping
ledges here and there projected so heavily
that it was easier to skirt around than to climb
over them. Brambles grew in shaggy patches;
trees intervened; more than once, gnarled roots,
struck but half in the ground, the bole rising at a
sharp angle with the incline, threw him out of the
line of a direct approach. He saw, in drawing
near, that he was as yet unperceived, as she made
her way slowly along the road. Her wonderful
eyes were fixed meditatively, softly, upon the blue
mountains beyond the Cove, showing through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
gap of the nearer purple ranges. Her lips had
a drooping curve. The golden glimmers of her
brown hair, rising in dense fairness above her
white brow, had never seemed to him so distinct.
She carried her pink sunbonnet in her hand; the
large loose curls floated on the shoulders of her
calico dress. It was of a sleazy texture, and the
skirt fell in starchless folds from a short waist to
the tops of her low-cut shoes. The color was a
rose pink, and on it was scattered a pattern of
great roses of the darkest red hue, and she looked
as fantastic as if she were attired for a fancy-dress
ball. Somehow, this accorded better with his
humor than the sombre homespun attire which the
mountain women as a rule affected. Her costume,
regarded as a fad, did not so diminish her beauty.
He could judge better of it, as he paused, still
unperceived because of the intervening brambles,
hardly ten feet from her. She looked like some
old picture, as, swinging the bonnet by one string,
she stood still for a moment, with an intent expression
in her lovely eyes.</p>

<p>“Ef he speaks so agin,” she said slowly, “ef he
speaks so agin afore them all, I dunno <i>how</i> I kin
abide it.”</p>

<p>There was a look of pain on her face which, however,
did not promise tears. He realized that
tears were scarce with her and came hard. It was
the look of one whose heart is pierced, and whose
pride is bent, and whose endurance flags. Then,
with an access of resolution visible in her soft face,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
she suddenly moved onward, and the swaying
sprays of the brambles painted the picture out.</p>

<p>He had hardly time to take stock of his impressions,
or note his own surprise, or marvel of what
or of whom she spoke, when Mrs. Sims issued,
waddling, from the house. She perceived him
readily enough, having him in mind, perhaps, and
called to him to hurry up, “for we-uns air all
goin’ ter meetin’ over yander at the church-house,
whar ye gin that show o’ yourn,” displaying a fat
dimply smile too jolly for the occasion, and all un-meet
to companion the Sabbath-day expression on
the sour visage of old Tubal Cain Sims, who was
shuffling out with high shoulders and hollow chest
and bent knees to join the family procession.</p>

<p>Lucien Royce welcomed the summons with the
half-bewildered delight of one unexpectedly rescued
from the extremest griefs of ennui. His first instinct
was to run and dress. Then remembering
that he wore the best clothes he had, he composed
himself with the reflection that he was in the fashion
as it prevailed here. He was consoled, too, as
he strolled along beside Mrs. Sims, for the lack of
a younger companion, by reflecting that he wanted
to make no mischief among any possible lovers of
Euphemia, which his public appearance walking
with her to church was well calculated to do.</p>

<p>“I think I am safe with Mrs. Sims,” he said to
himself. “I suppose nobody is in love with her,—not
even old Tubal Cain, whatever he may once
have been.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>He cast a glance at the lean and active partner
of Mrs. Sims’s joys and sorrows, forging along at
a brisk pace which was certain to land him in
church before the rest of the household had achieved
half the distance.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Cove was no longer silent. Akin to the
cadence of the echo, one with the ethereal essence
of the sighing and lapsing of the mountain stream,
the distant choiring of the congregation in the
unseen “church-house” seemed some indigenous
voice of the wilderness, so sylvan, so plaintive, so
replete with subtle solemn intimations, was the
sound. The juggler did not at once distinguish it.
Then it came anew with more definite meaning,
and it smote upon his quivering, lacerated sensibilities.
Not that in the sophisticated life which
he had quitted he had valued the Sunday sermons,
or cared for the house of the Lord, save architecturally;
but he had loved the Sunday singing; the
great swelling reverberations of the organ were
wont to stir his very heart-strings; and while he
appreciated the scope and the worth of the standard
compositions of sacred music, he was always keen
and critically alert to hear any new thing, with
due allowance for the lower level. And should
the consecrated hour prove heavy to his spirits, did
not his seat near the door, his hat at hand, his
quick, noiseless, deft step, provide amply for his
retreat? With the realization of the loss of his
life, his home, poignantly renewed by the vibrations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
of the long, sustained, psalmodic tones, he
would fain have turned back now; but the idea of
the tedious solitude on the ledge of the river-bank,
his heavy thoughts, the dread of the remonstrances
and urgency of Mrs. Sims, constrained him. So
he listened to the solemn rise and fall of the hymning
in the Cove, rising and falling with the wind,
with a new sense of aghast trouble fixed upon him,
as if some spectral thing had revealed itself in the
wilderness as he walked unwary.</p>

<p>Now and then, as they wended along amongst
the great boles of the trees, with a narrow brook
splashing and foaming in the deep rocky gully at
one side of the red clay road, or losing itself in
the densities of the laurel pressing so close on
either hand, he caught in sudden turns through
gaps in the foliage glimpses of the winding way
further on and of Euphemia’s rose-hued dress.
She was making but indifferent speed, despite the
nimbleness of those “stout little brogans” that
could cover the ground so fast when the will nerved
them. Once he saw her standing in an open space
and looking over the levels of the Cove below.
Her pink bonnet was on her head now, its flaring
brim pushed far back, and revealing that Pompadour-like
effect of her fair hair which he so much
admired, and here and there the large loose curls
straying on her shoulders. With the short waist
of her dress, and the long, straight, limp skirt, the
picture-like suggestion was so complete that he had
not one throb of that repulsion which ignorance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
and coarse surroundings occasioned his dilettante
exactingness. He looked at her with a kindling
eye, a new and alert interest. He began to seek
to divine her mental processes. Why was she
so reluctant? why did she hesitate? It could not
be that the prospect of the dull droning of the
preacher affrighted her; she was not wont to seek
her ease, and he knew instinctively that her Spartan
endurance would enable her to listen as long
as the longest-winded of the saints could hold
forth. Were her lips moving? He could not be
sure at the distance. Was she saying once more,
“Ef he speaks so agin afore ’em all, I dunno <i>how</i>
I kin abide it”?</p>

<p>He wondered who “he” could be—not Jack
Ormsby, he was very sure. He wondered how
Euphemia should have mustered the feeling to
care. She seemed to him not complex, like other
women. Her character was built of two elements,
kindred and of the nature of complement one to
the other,—pride and the love of power, the desire
to rule. He had thought her possessed of as
much coquetry at eighteen as her grandmother
might have at eighty-five. And who was this
“he” who brought that look of sweet solicitude,
almost a quiver, to her lips?</p>

<p>“I should like to knock ‘him’ down,” he said
to himself, humoring the theory of his pretended
infatuation.</p>

<p>She turned suddenly, holding up her head with
a look of determination, and went on as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Far afield might Pride seem, to be sure, in the
humble ways of these few settlers in the wilderness,
yet here he was in full panoply, to walk, almost visibly,
alongside the simple mountain maiden, to
enter even the church with her, and to take his
seat beside her on one of the rude benches, already
crowded.</p>

<p>Her mother and the juggler were later still.
The diurnal aspect of the little gray unpainted
building in the midst of the green shadows of the
great forests, with the wide-spreading boughs of
the trees interlacing above its roof, was not familiar
to Royce, who had been here only after dark
on the evening of his memorable entertainment.
The array of yokes of oxen, of wagons, of saddle-horses
hitched to the trees, had been noisily invisible
in the blackness, on that occasion. The group
of youths hanging about the sacred edifice outside
had a prototype in the Sunday curbstone gatherings
everywhere, and he at once identified the species.
A vague haze of dust pervaded the interior;
it gave a certain aspect of unreality to the ranks
of intent figures on the benches, as if they were
of the immaterial populace of dreams. A slant of
the rich-hued sunlight fell athwart the room in a
broad bar of a dully glamourous effect, showing
a thousand shifting motes floating in the ethereal
medium. A kindred tint glowed in the folds of
a yellow bandanna handkerchief swinging from
one of the dark brown beams, and served to advertise
its loss by some worshiper at the last meeting.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
Not so cheerful was another waif from past
congregations,—a baby’s white knitted woolen
hood; it looked like the scalp of this shorn lamb of
the flock, and was vaguely suggestive of prowling
wolves. On the platform were four preachers
who were participating in the exercises of the day.
Two of muscular and massive form had an agricultural
aspect rather than that of laborers in a spiritual
vineyard, and were clad in brown jeans with
rough, muddy cowhide boots; they were dogmatic
of countenance, and evidently well fed and
pampered to the verge of arrogance; they sat tilted
back in their splint-bottomed chairs, chewing hard
on their quids of tobacco, and wearing a certain
easy, capable, confident mien as of an assurance of
heavenly matters and a burly enjoyment of worldly
prominence. They listened to a hymn which the
third—whom Royce recognized as old Parson
Greenought—was “lining out,” as he stood at the
table, with a kind of corroborative air as became
past masters in all spiritual craft. They had traveled
the road their colleague sought to point out in
metre, and were not to be surprised at any of its
long-ago-surmounted obstacles. At the end of
every couplet, each of them, while still seated, burst
into song with such patent disregard of the pitch
of the other, the whole congregation blaring after,
that the juggler quaked and winced as he sat
among the men,—the women being carefully
segregated on the other side of the church,—and
had much ado to set his teeth and avoid wry faces.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
The fourth minister was not singing. He sat with
his head bowed in his hand, his elbow supported
by the arm of his chair, as if lost in silent prayer.
The juggler watched his every motion as for
deliverance from the surging waves of sound, permeated
with that rancorous independence of unison,
which floated around him, for he divined that
this was the orator of the day. This young man
lifted his face expectantly after a time,—a keen,
thin, pale face, with black hair and dark gray eyes,
and an absorbed ascetic expression. But Parson
Greenought still “lined out” the sacred poetry,
which was hobbling as to metre, and often without
connection and bereft of meaning; and with a wide
opening of the mouth and a toss of the head, the
two musically disposed pastors resolutely led the
singing, and the congregation chorused tumultuously.
It was in some sort discipline for Brother
Absalom Tynes to be obliged to sit in silence and
wait while stanza followed stanza and theme was
added to theme in the multifarious petition psalmodically
preferred. The words were on his lips;
his heart burned for utterance; he quivered with
the very thought of his pent-up message. He was
of that class of young preachers who have gone
into the vineyard early, and with a determination
to convert the world single-handed. Nothing but
time and Satan can moderate their enthusiasms;
but time and Satan may be trusted. Too much
zeal,—misdirected, young, unseemly, foolish,—Brother
Tynes had been given to understand, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
his great fault, his besetting sin; it would do
more harm than good, and he had been admonished
to pray against it. Perhaps the exhibition
of it grated on his elder <i>confrères</i> as an unintentional
rebuke, beneath which they secretly smarted,
remembering a time long ago—but of short duration,
it may be—when they too had been fired
with wild enthusiasm and were full of mad projects,
and went about turning every stone and wearying
even the godly with the name of the Lord.
So, to use the phrase of the politicians, they
“paired off” with Satan, as it were; forgetting
that zeal is like gunpowder, once damped, forever
damaged, and that their own had caught no spark
from any chance contiguous fire this many a long
day.</p>

<p>That singing praises to the Lord should be a
means of “putting down” Brother Tynes savors
of the incongruous; but few human motives are
less complex than those which animated Parson
Greenought as he combined the edification of the
congregation, the melody of worship, and the
reduction of the pride of the pulpit orator, whose
fame already extended beyond Etowah, and even
to Tanglefoot Cove. The science of “putting
down” any available subject is capable of utilizing
and amalgamating unpromising elements, and as
Parson Greenought cast up his eyes while he sang,
and preserved a certain sanctimonious swaying of
the body to and fro with the rhythm of the hymn
he “lined out,” the triumph of “simulating”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
these several discordant mental processes cost him
no conscious effort and scarcely a realized impulse.</p>

<p>The juggler looked about him with a sort of
averse curiosity; the traits of ignorant people
appealed in no respect to his somewhat finical prepossessions.
Among his various knacks and talents
was no pictorial facility, nor the perception of the
picturesque as a mental attitude. He resented the
assumption of special piety in the postures and
facial expression here and there noticeable in the
congregation; he could have singled out those
religionists whom he fancied thus vying with one
another. One broad-shouldered and stalwart young
man was given to particularly conspicuous demonstrations
of godliness, exemplified chiefly in sudden
startling “A-a-a-mens” sonorously interpolated
into the reading, a breathy, raucous blare of song
as he lifted up his voice,—inexpressibly off the
key,—and a sanctimonious awkward pose of the
head with half-shut eyes. The juggler could have
trounced this saint with hearty good will, for no
other reason than that the man took pleasure in
showing how religious he was! Only Mrs. Sims
exhibited no outward token of her happy estate as
a “perfesser,” but her salvation was considered a
very doubtful matter, and even that she had “found
peace” problematical, since she did not believe in
special judgments alighting on the mistaken or the
unconverted, and had surmised that the Lord would
find out a way to excuse “them that had set on
the mourners’ bench” in vain. “Ef you hev jes’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
started out,” she would say to those unfortunate
wights whom the members were allowed to persecute
with advice and exhortation as they cowered
before the throne of grace, “don’t <i>you</i> be ’feard.
The Lord will meet ye more ’n halfway. Ef ye
don’t see him, ’tain’t because he ain’t thar. Jes’
start out. That’s all!”</p>

<p>But Parson Greenought had warned her to forbear
these promissory pledges of so easy a salvation.
For he wanted sinners all to gaze on that
lake of brimstone and fire which none but him
could so successfully navigate; and now and again
he had his triumph when some wretch in agonies
of terror would screech out that he or she was “so
happy! so happy!” since to be “happy” by main
force, so to speak, was the alternative he offered
to the prospect of weltering there forever. So
Jane Ann Sims held her peace, and preserved a
fat and placid solemnity of countenance, and sang
aloud in such wheezy audacity that the juggler
could hear her breathe across the church.</p>

<p>Only one countenance was doubtful, wistful, its
muscles not adjusted to the discerning gaze of the
congregation. Euphemia Sims sat near a window,
the tempered light on the soft contours of her face.
The flaring pink sunbonnet framed the rising
mass of fair hair; she gazed absently down at the
floor; her delicate young shoulders were outlined
upon the masses of green leaves fluttering above
the sill hard by. Her look so riveted Royce’s
attention that he sought to decipher it. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
did she fear? There was a suggestion of wounded
pride, most appealing in its incongruity with her
normal calm, or hardness, or unresponsiveness, or
whatever he might choose to call the nullity of
that habitual untranslated expression. Why was
she so grave, so sad? The sudden lifting of her
long lashes and the intent fixing of her eyes directed
his attention to the pulpit, and there he
perceived that Brother Tynes was standing at last,
beginning to elucidate his text. The juggler,
relieved of the torture of the singing, braced his
nerves for the torture of the sermon. Here he
might have had a recourse in his facility of abstracting
his mind. He had sat through many a
sermon in this unreceptive state. He had cast
up accounts, preserving a duality of identity in
the secular activity of his mental faculties and the
sabbatical decorum of his face and listening attitude.
Between firstly and secondly he had once
chased down three vagrant cents,—an error which
had cost him fifteen hours of labor out of regular
working time,—without which he could not balance
his accounts. Once—it was during the
Christmas holidays—he had utilized the peroration
of a long and searching discourse by the
bishop of the diocese to evolve certain new and
effective figures for the german which he was to
lead the next evening, and he had always esteemed
that hour a most fruitful occasion. And again,
during a special sermon, on foreign missions, he
evolved a little melody, hardly more than a repetitious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
phrase, forever turning and coiling and
doubling on itself, to which he adapted the artfully
repetitious words of a dainty chansonnette
of a celebrated French poet with such skill and
delicate inspiration of fitness that he often sang it
afterward in choice musical circles to unbounded
applause. He had sat under the sound of the
gospel all his life, and he was as thorough a pagan
as any savage. But alack! his was not the only
deaf ear in those congregations—more’s the pity!
and while we send missionaries to China and the
slums of our own great cities, our civilized heathen
of the upper classes are out of reach.</p>

<p>It was perhaps because he now had no thought
that would let him be friends with it—no sedulously
conserved accounts, no <i>bizarreries</i> of the
german to devise, no inspiration of melody in mind
(the psalmody of Etowah Cove was enough to
strike the music in him dumb for evermore)—that
he followed the direction of Euphemia’s gaze
and composed himself to listen.</p>

<p>He encountered a sudden and absolute surprise.
The sermon was one of those examples of a fiery
natural eloquence which sometimes serve to show
to the postulant of culture how endowment may
begin at the point where training leaves off. The
rapt silence of Brother Tynes’s audience and their
kindling faces attested the reciprocal fervors of
his enthusiasms. He was awkward and unlettered,
with uncouth gestures and an uncultivated voice,
but there burned like a white fire in his pale, thin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
face a faith, an adoration, an exultation, which
transfigured it. He had a fine and lofty ideal in
the midst of the contortions of his ignorance,
which he called doctrines, and presently he spoke
only and in proteanwise of the mystery and the
mercy of Redeeming Love. The idea of reward,
of punishment, of the hope of heaven and the fear
of hell, did not seem to enter into his scheme of
salvation. He sought to grasp the realization of
an infinite sacrificial love, and he adjured his
people to fall on their faces, with their faces in
the dust, before the sacred marvel of the Atonement.
The text “He first loved us” rang out
again and again like a clarion call. Its simple
cogency seemed to need no argument. How could
the politic and mercenary motives of securing
exemption from pain or the purchase of pleasure
enter herein? That phase of striking a fair bargain,
so controlling to sordid human nature, was
for the moment preposterous. Many a one of his
simple hearers knew the joy of unrequited labor
for love’s sweet sake, of self-denial, of being
hungry or tired or cold, in sacrificial content.
More than one mother could hardly have given a
practical reason why the crippled child or the ailing
one should be the dearest, when its nurture could
rouse no expectation that it might live to work for
her sake. More than one gray-haired son loved
and honored the paralytic troublous old dotard in
the warmest corner of the fireside all the more for
his helplessness and the toil for his sake. Love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
makes duty dear. Love makes service light. In
some one phase or other they all knew that love
is for love’s own sake.</p>

<p>And this was all that he demanded in the great
prophetic name of Christ even from the dread
heights of Calvary, “My son, give me thine heart.”</p>

<p>Now and again sobs punctuated the discourse.
Before there was any call for mourners to approach
the bench, an old white-headed man, who
had resisted many an appeal to his fears on behalf
of his soul, rose and shambled forward; others
silently joined him where he sat looking at them
over his shoulder, very conscious, a trifle crest-fallen,
if not ashamed, thus to be forced from the
stanch defenses which he had defiantly held through
many a siege. The assisting ministers occasionally
cleared their throats and shifted their crossed legs,
with an expression of countenance which might be
interpreted as deprecation of the factitious excitements
of a sensational sermon.</p>

<p>Euphemia Sims hearkened with a face of perfect
decorum and superficial receptiveness. In her
heart, rather than in her mind, she missed the true
interpretation of the discourse. It did not seem to
her so wonderful that she should be of a degree of
importance to merit salvation. To be sure, in the
sense of sharing original sin she supposed she was
a sinner,—born so. But her life was ordered on
a line of rectitude. Who kept so clean a house,
who wove and milked and cooked and sewed so
diligently, as she? Who led for years the spelling-class<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
in this very house, whose brown walls might
tell of her orthographic triumphs? And she had
got her religion, too, and had even shouted one
day, albeit a quavering, half-hearted hosanna. So
she looked on with a calm post-graduate manner
at the gathering penitents at the mourners’ bench.
She too had passed through the preliminary stages
of spiritual culture, and had taken her degree.</p>

<p>The juggler, as he listened, repeatedly felt that
cold thrill which he was wont to associate with a
certain effect on his critical faculties. Only a high
degree of excellence in whatever line appealing to
them was capable of eliciting it. He had experienced
it in this measure hitherto only in the pleasurable
suspense and excitement, so intense as to
be almost pain, in the dress circle of some crowded
play-house, at the triumphant moment of a masterpiece
in the science of histrionism.</p>

<p>The orator was approaching his climax. To so
great a height had he risen that it seemed as if his
utmost power could not reach beyond; every moment
tingled with the expectation that the next
word must herald a collapse, when, suddenly throwing
himself on his knees, he cried, “Lead us in
prayer, Brother Haines,—lead us in prayer to
the foot of the cross!”</p>

<p>There was a startled movement among his colleagues
of the pulpit, charged with the prosaic suggestion
that if they could they would deny Brother
Haines—apparently a layman and seated among
the congregation—the opportunity of thus publicly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
approaching the throne of grace; but the
people already had crowded upon their knees, and
a suppliant voice, pitched on a different key, rose
into the stillness.</p>

<p>Euphemia Sims sat for a moment as if she were
turned to stone. A light both of pain and of
anger was in her eyes. Her lips were stern and
compressed. She felt her blood beating hard in
her temples. Then she remembered the exacting
decorums of the exercise, gathered her trim pink
skirts about her, softly knelt down, and Pride
knelt down beside her.</p>

<p>She hardly heard the voice of Brother Owen
Haines at first, as she put her dimpled elbows on
the hard bench and held her head between her
hands, so tumultuous were the surging pulses of
humiliation and fear, and of love, too, in a way.
And then it asserted itself upon her senses, although
she was conscious first merely of tones, rich, mellow,
of delicate modulations and lingering vibrations,—differing
infinitely from the clear, incisive,
somewhat harsh utterances of the preacher; but at
last words came gradually to her comprehension.</p>

<p>Commonplace words enough, to be sure, to excite
so poignant a torture of agonized expectation in
that heart, beating as one with Pride’s, but presently
too oft repeated. Now and again a raucously
cleared throat amongst the row of kneeling
ministers told of a nervous stress of anxiety as to
these verbal stumblings and inadequacies. Sometimes
a sentence was definitely broken, subject and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
predicate hopelessly disjointed. Sometimes a clause
barely suggested the thought in the brain, an irremediable
solution of continuity in its expression.
More than once occurred a painful pause, in which
the heads of certain newly regenerate sinners,
easily falling again under mundane influences or
the control of Satan, turned alertly from the
prayerful attitudes still conserved by their bodies
to covertly survey the spellbound suppliant. Like
unto these was the juggler. He had, on the first
summons to prayer, decorously assumed that half-crouching
posture common to devotionally disposed
men, which intimates to the surrounding spectators
the fact of a certain polite subduement of mind
and body to divine worship. Then, remembering
suddenly the character of mountaineer which he
designed to assimilate, he plumped down on his
knees—for the first time in many a long day—like
the rest. And if in the ensuing excitements
his mind did not match his lowly attitude, the
juggler is not the only man who has ever been upon
his knees with no prayer in his heart. Taking
license from the stir near at hand, he too shifted
his posture that his furtive glance might command
a view of the man thus deputed to pray.</p>

<p>The suppliant was among the congregation, but
his face, as he knelt in an open space near the pulpit,
was irradiated by the slant of the sunset glow.
Beheld above the benches and the kneeling congregation,
it had a singularly detached effect,—it
was like the painting of a head; all else was canceled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
For a moment, the juggler, his eyes growing
intent and grave as he gazed, could not account
for a sense of familiarity with it, of having seen it
often before. Then, with a reminiscence of dim
religious surroundings, of tempered radiance streaming
through translucent mediums, of flecks of deep
rich tints,—red and blue and purple and amber,
always with emitted undertones of light,—he
realized its association with church windows, with
the heights of clerestory twilight, with catherine-wheels
luminous in dark transepts, with trifoliated
symbols in chancel arches. It might have seemed,
the idealizing glamour of the sunset in the rapt
devotional expression, a study for a seraph’s face;
in truth, one could hardly desire a more fitting presentment
of the angelic type. The fair hair, not
gold even under the heightening sunlight, lay in
gentle infantile curves along the broad forehead;
as it fell to the shoulder it showed tendencies to
heavy undulations that were scarcely curls or ringlets,
and that grew diaphanous and cloudy toward
their fibrous verges. The large languid blue eyes
had long dark lashes, and the pathetic fervors, the
adoration, the entreaty of their expression, moved
sundry covert glances to a twinkle of laughter;
for this surpassed in some humorous sort the liberal
limits assigned to the outward show of devotion in
Etowah Cove. None of its other denizens ever
looked like that, saint or sinner! It was a subtle
and complex expression, and, being incomprehensible,
it struck most of the observers as simply funny.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
The high cheekbones and the pale unrounded
cheek might have impressed an artist as somewhat
too attenuated of contour to suggest the enjoyment
of the eternal bliss of heaven, but they added to
the extreme spirituality of the effect of the eyes,
and with the congruous but delicate irregular nose
and full lips made the face unusual and individual.</p>

<p>An odd face for the butt of a coarse joke. The
congregation, still kneeling, stirred with a ripple
of silent laughter. Here and there, as the glances
of curious worshipers, looking furtively over the
shoulder, encountered one another, a gleam of caustic
comment or deprecating amusement was exchanged;
and once a newly caught saint, not yet
having wholly dropped the manners and quirks of
the Old Man, from force of habit winked, wrinkled
his nose, and grinned. For the halting supplication,
still offered in that melting melody of intonation,
had passed from its disconnected plea for
mercy, for the conversion of sinners, for the guidance
of the congregation, for the spiritual profit of
the meeting, and had boldly entered on a personal
and unique petition, a prayer for the power to
preach the gospel. The day of miracles, the
learned say, is past. Even the illiterate congregation
in Etowah Cove expected none to be wrought in
its midst. And surely only the hand of God could
touch that faltering tongue to the full expression
of the thought that trembled impotently upon it.
What subtle unimagined rift was it between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
mind and the word, what breach in their mysterious
telegraphy! Elsewhere the phenomenon exists: the
silent poet, whose metre beats in certain dumb fervors
of the pulse; the painter, whose picture glows
only upon the retina of the mind’s eye; or those,
unhappily not quiescent, who blurt and blunder as
did Owen Haines in his incoherent monologue to
Almighty God. But he was the single example in
the experience of Etowah Cove, and to the literal-minded
saints the spectacle of a man bent upon
preaching the gospel, and yet so ill fitted for the
task that he could scarce put half a dozen words
into a faltering sentence, moved them now to mirth
and now to wrath, according to the preponderance
of merry or ascetic religionists in the assembly.
Again and again, whenever an opportunity was
vouchsafed, Owen Haines, with his illumined face
and passionate appealing voice, publicly besought
of God in the congregations of worshipers, where
he felt prayer must most surely prevail, with the
pulse and the heart and the word of all his world
to bear him company to the throne of grace, the
power to preach the gospel:—in such phrase, such
few repetitious disjointed words, <i>disjecta membra</i>
of supplication, with so flagrant a display of hopeless
incapacity, that it became almost the scandal
of the meetings, and there had been a tacit agreement
among the ministers who were to conduct the
revival that he should not be called upon to pray.
The exhibition of his eloquent burning face and his
halting words, his faith and its open reiterated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
denial, was not deemed edifying; and indeed it
had latterly begun to affect the gravity of certain
members of the congregation of whose conversion
the leaders had had great hopes.</p>

<p>“He hev got ter fight that thar question out
alone,” said old man Greenought in indignation.
“I won’t gin him nare ’nother ‘Amen.’ He an’
his tomfool wantin’ ter preach the gorspel whenst
he can’t pray a ’spectable prayer is a puffick blemish
on the divine service; it’s fairly makin’ game
o’ serious things,—his prayin’ fur the power,—an’
I dunno what the Lord is a-goin’ ter do about
it, but <i>I</i> ain’t a-goin’ ter lend <i>my</i> ear nare ’nother
time.”</p>

<p>It was this choleric gentleman who at last half
rose from his knees, and with a peremptory jerk
of his thumb toward the failing sunlight brought
Haines’s aspiring spirit back to earth. He had
gone far on the wings of those poor words, he had
flown high. His thought had so possessed him that
he did not realize what slight tincture of it his
speech distilled for those who heard him. The ministerial
thumb jerking a warning of the flight of time,
a certain covert jeer in the bent half-covered faces
of those about him, brought the fact to him that
this prayer was like so many others, voiced only
in the throbs of his heart. The light was dying out
of his eyes, the sunset glow had quitted him; no
fine illumined countenance now he bore, as of one
who looks on some transcendent vision; only a conscious
disciplined face, quiet and humbled and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
patient! He broke off suddenly to say “Amen,”
for he sacrificed no connection,—he hardly knew
whither he was rambling,—and the people scrambled
noisily to their feet, eager for dispersing.</p>

<p>“What did you-uns call on him fur, ennyhow?”
said old Greenought bluffly to Absalom Tynes.
He had somewhat of a swaggering manner as he
came up close to the thin, pallid young man. He
took great joy in all the militant tropes descriptive
of the Christian estate, and with the more liberty
suited his secular manner to his ministerial rhetoric.
Since he waged so brisk a warfare against
Sin and Satan, he often seemed about to turn his
weapons, as if to keep his hand in, against his
unoffending fellow man.</p>

<p>Absalom Tynes did not flinch. “I called on
him,” he said a trifle drearily, for the fire of his
exaltation, too, was quenched in that pathetic and
ineffectual “prayin’ fur the power,” “kase ez I war
a-preachin’ the word I knowed he war a-followin’
me, an’ I ’lowed I hed got him ter the p’int whar
surely he mought lift up his heart. I ’lowed the
Lord mought take pity on him ez longs ter serve
him, an’ so touch his lips an’ gin him the gift o’ a
tongue o’ fire. I can’t sense it, somehow,—I
don’t onderstand it.”</p>

<p>“I do,” Parson Greenought capably averred.
“The Lord’s put him in the place whar he wants
him, an’ he’ll be made ter stay thar,—jes’ a-persistin’
in prayin’ fur the power!”</p>

<p>“Thar ain’t no lock an’ key on prayer ez I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
knows on,” responded the other a trifle testily.
“A man kin pray fur what he wills.”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ he kin do without it, too, unless the
Lord wills. Fight the devices o’ Satan, an’ don’t
git ter be a beggar at the throne fur gratifyin’ yer
own yearthly quirks. Prayin’ an’ a-prayin’ fur the
power! The power’s a gift, my brother, a free
gift, an’ no man will git it by baigin’ an’ baigin’
an’ teasin’ fur it.”</p>

<p>He strode off, feeling that he had had the best
of the discussion. He was discerning enough to
be conscious that, despite his belligerencies, he was
often inferior to his youthful <i>confrère</i> in the rhetoric
of the pulpit, and he relished the more worsting
him in argument, thus proving the superiority
of his judgment and solid reasoning capacities.</p>

<p>Outside the door a group of loiterers still lingered.
The juggler’s prudential motives had collapsed
utterly in the prospect of Mrs. Sims’s society
in the long walk home. He looked about him
with a desperate hope of diversion, in which Euphemia
and the curiosity she had newly excited
were factors. But he was fain to be content with
his elderly companion, for as Euphemia’s rose-hued
dress blossomed in the portal against the dark
brown background of the interior he noticed that
Owen Haines was standing at the foot of the steps
evidently awaiting her. The mountaineer gave her
no greeting, but walked beside her as if his companionship
were a matter of course.</p>

<p>“Warn’t that a plumb special sermon?” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
said enthusiastically, turning his candid eyes upon
her. “’Pears like ter me ’twar the best, the meltin’est,
the searchin’est discourse I ever hear.”</p>

<p>There was a measure of contempt in her face.
She would not have admitted that she thought herself
too good for the need of salvation, but the
theme with all its cognate elements was palling.
She replied with a definite note of sarcasm in her
voice. “The bes’? Waal, I hev hearn ye say
that time an’ time agin. The sermons air <i>all</i> the
bes’, ’cordin’ ter you-uns.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he admitted a trifle drearily, “ef I lose
my soul, ’twon’t be bekase I ain’t hed the bes’
chance fur salvation. I hev sot under a power o’
good an’ discernin’ sermons in my time.”</p>

<p>The seraphic suggestions of his face, now that
he was recalled to earth, were little marked, and
presently totally merged when he clapped his big
broad-brimmed hat upon that mass of cloudy, fine-fibred
fair hair. The irreverent juggler could
have laughed at the swiftness and completeness of
the transition. Haines still wore that dreamy, far-away
look which, however, with mundane associations
and modern garb, is apt to indicate an unpurposeful
nature and a lack of energy rather
than any lofty ideals and high resolves. The perfect
chiseling and contour of his countenance and
its refined intimations were still patent to the discerning
observer; but without the preconceived
idea drawn in the church from the aspect of his
head, with the soul revealed for one rapt moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
through its facial expression,—picture-like, dissevered
from the suggestion of body—Royce would
hardly have perceived any spiritual trait of a higher
type in the young mountaineer. Thus it is that only
the outer man is known of men, and that ethereal
essence of thought and emotion, the real being, is a
stranger upon earth and foreign from the beginning.</p>

<p>Royce, greedily snatching at the very straws of
abstraction, watched the young couple as they
strolled slowly along the red clay road. The
slouching, thin, languid figure of the tall youth,
the ill-fitting suit of brown jeans with the coat
hanging so loosely from the narrow shoulders, the
big white hat, the rough crumpled boots all appealed
to him with a pleasant sense of incongruity
as the accoutrement of this object of mistaken
identity, when a golden harp and a white robe and
a sweep of wings would better have become the
first glimpse caught in the church. Now and again,
mechanically, involuntarily, Euphemia looked furtively
back over her shoulder at Royce. With all
that surging pulse of pride in her heart she was
strangely bereft of her wonted assurance. It
would never have occurred to her, in her normal
sphere of thought and action, to refer aught that
concerned her to the judgment, the problematic
opinion of another. But although she gave him
so slight thought, although she could not definitely
gauge its objects and interests, she had not been
unnoting of that subtle pervasive mockery which
characterized the juggler’s habit of mind. Until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
now, however, she had not cared at what or at
whom the “game-maker” laughed, how loud, how
long. The laughter of folly cannot serve to mock
good substantial common sense which affords no
purchase for ridicule; it rebounds only upon the
mocker. She apprehended naught in herself, her
home, her parents, the Cove, deserving of scorn
or sneers. Her pride was proof against this. It
was because she herself deemed her lover ridiculous
that she winced from Royce’s imagined laugh
now, as she had shrunk from the criticism of the
rest of the congregation. But this mockery was
of the intimate fireside circle. For Royce would
go home with them, and bring it in his laugh, his
glance; nay, she would be conscious of it even
in his silent recollections. She felt she had no
refuge from it. She told herself that because she
loved Haines she deprecated mockery as unworthy
of him, she would fain shield him from the sneers
of those not half so good as he. She would rather
he should eat out his heart in silence than besiege
the throne of grace in any manner not calculated
to inspire respect and admiration in those
who heard his words addressed to the Almighty.
As to the Deity, the goal of all these petitions,
she never once thought of their spiritual effect,
the possibility of an answer. She esteemed the
prayer as in the nature of a public speech, a public
exhibition, which, glorious in success, is contemptible
in its failure in proportion to the number
of witnesses and the scope of the effort. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
could Owen Haines pray for the power to preach,
when there was Absalom Tynes looking on so
vainglorious and grand, doubtless esteeming himself
a most “servigrous” exhorter, and obviously
vaunting his own godliness by implication in the
fervor with which he called sinners to repentance?
How could Owen Haines seek so openly, so painfully,
so terribly insistently, as a privilege, a boon,
as an answer to all his prayers, as a sign from the
heavens, as a token of salvation, as the price of his
life, that capacity which was possessed so conspicuously,
without a word of prayer, without a moment
of spiritual wrestling, without a conscious effort,
by Absalom Tynes?</p>

<p>“I’d content myself with the power ter plough,”
she said to herself.</p>

<p>Then, as he fell into retrospective thought, she
said aloud,—her voice not ringing true as was its
wont, but with a tremulous uncertain vibration,—“’Pears
like ter me, ez ye hain’t been gin the
power arter sech a sight o’ prayer, ’twould be
better ter stop baigin’ an’ pesterin’ the Lord
’bout’n it.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence, during which the
little roadside rill flung out on the air the rudiments
of a song,—a high crystalline tremor, a
whispering undertone, a comprehensive surging
splash as of all its miniature currents resolved into
one chord <i>con tutta forza</i>, and so to whispering
and tentative tinklings again. He had turned his
clear long-lashed blue eyes upon her, and she saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
the reproach in them. That courage in the feminine
heart which dares wreak cruelty on its own
tender fibres urged her.</p>

<p>“I hev tole ye that afore,” she added sternly.</p>

<p>He was still silent. So sacred was that disregarded
petition of his that, despite the publicity
of its preferment, its free unrestrained fervors, he
could hardly discuss it, even with her.</p>

<p>“Ye hain’t hed no advices from the Lord,” she
argued. “Ye hev been prayin’ fur the power
constant, ever since ye got religion, an’ the Lord
don’t take no notice o’ ye.”</p>

<p>A shadow was on his face, pain in his eyes.
Any one more merciful than the proud woman
who loved him, and who would fain conserve his
pride, might have pitied the sudden revulsion from
the enthusiastic pleasure in the sacred themes of
the sermon so late upon his lip and firing his eye—which
she accounted merely the triumphs of
Absalom Tynes—to this abasement and sorrow
and prescient despair.</p>

<p>“I kin wait on his will,” he said humbly.</p>

<p>“Waal, ye better wait in silence,” Euphemia
declared, near to the brink of tears,—angry and
wounded and scornful tears.</p>

<p>“‘Ask an’ ye shall receive, seek an’ ye shall
find,’” he quoted pertinently, with that upbraiding
look in his eyes which hurt her for his sake, and
which she resented for her own.</p>

<p>“How long! how long!” she cried impetuously.
“Will ye spen’ yer life askin’ fur what’s denied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
ye, seekin’ fur what’s hidden from ye? The
Lord’s got nuthin’ fur ye, Owen, an’ by this time
ye oughter hev sensed that.”</p>

<p>“Then I kin pray fur the grace ter take denial
from his hands like a rich gift,” he declared, his
face kindling with an illumined, uplifted look.</p>

<p>“Oh, yer prayin’ an’ prayin’! I’m plumb
wore out with it!” she cried, stopping still in the
road; then realizing the advance of the others she
walked on hastily, and with the affectation of a
careless gesture she took off her bonnet and swung
it debonairly by the string, lest any emotional
crisis be inferred from her abrupt halt. “Owen
Haines,” she said, with sudden inspiration, “ye
air deceived by Satan. Ye ain’t wantin’ the power
ter preach the gospel ter advance the kingdom.
Ye want the power ter prance ez prideful ez a
peacock in the pul-<i>pit</i>, like Absalom Tynes an’
them other men what air cuttin’ sech a dash afore
the yearth ez keeps ’em from keerin’ much <i>how</i>
the nangels in heaven air weepin’ over ’em.”</p>

<p>He recoiled from this thrust, for, however his
charity might seek to ignore the fact, however his
simplicity might fail to discern it, his involuntary
intuition made him well aware that “prancing ez
prideful ez a peacock” was not altogether foreign
to the pulpit here or elsewhere, and that undue
vainglory must needs wait on special proficiency.
She felt that she struck hard in imputing to him a
motive of which he knew himself to be incapable.
Perhaps he would have pleased her better had he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
combined his religious fervors with any intention
so practical, so remunerative, so satisfying to the
earthly sentiment of one not too good to live in
this world.</p>

<p>It was eminently in keeping with that phase of
his character which she most contemned that he
should, with his cheek still flushed, with his eyes
wincing and narrowing as from a blow, begin a
vehement defense, not of himself and his motives,
but of Absalom Tynes.</p>

<p>She would hardly listen. “I hev hearn ye talk
about Absalom Tynes, an’ I don’t want ter hear
no mo’. I know what I know. Tell me thar ain’t
no pride in the pul-<i>pit</i>,—a-readin’ an’ a-talkin’
an’ a-preachin’ so glib an’ precise, an’ showin’ off
so gran’ afore the wimminfolks, an’ a-singin’ so
full-mouthed an’ loud, an’ bein’ the biggest man
thar; fur Satan, though he often gits his club-foot
on the pul-<i>pit</i> stairs, ain’t never been knowed ter
step up! Ye tell me that ain’t true ’bout some,
ef not that precious friend o’ yourn, Absalom
Tynes?”</p>

<p>“Euphemia,” he said sternly in his turn, and
her heart was full at the tone of his voice, “I
dunno what idee you-uns hev got; ye ’pear so—so—diff’unt—so”—He
hesitated; his words
were not wont to be ready.</p>

<p>“So diff’unt from what? From you-uns? I
reckon so! Ef I war ter drap dead this minit,
nuthin’, nuthin’ could hev made me act like you-uns,
prayin’ an’ prayin’ fur the power ter preach—whenst—whenst—Owen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
Haines, ye ain’t even
got the power ter pray! The Lord denies ye that—even
the power ter ax so ez—ter be fitten fur
<i>folks</i> ter hear!”</p>

<p>“The Lord kin hear, Euphemy; he reads the
secret thoughts.”</p>

<p>“Let yourn be secret, then!” cried Euphemia.
“Fur the folks air listenin’ too ter the thoughts
which the Lord kin hear ’thout the need o’ words—listenin’
an’—an’, Owen Haines, laffin’!” She
choked back a sob, as her eyes filled and the tears
ran out on her scarlet cheek. With a stealthy
gesture she wiped them away with the curtain of
her pink sunbonnet, carrying herself very stiffly
lest some unconsidered turn of the head betray her
rush of emotion to the other church-goers loitering
behind. When she lifted her eyes, the flow of
tears all stanched, her sobs curbed, she beheld his
eyes fixed sorrowfully upon her.</p>

<p>“D’ye ’low I dunno that, Euphemy?” he said,
his voice trembling. “D’ye ’low I don’t see ’em
an’ hear ’em too when I’m nigh the Amen?”</p>

<p>Her tears burst out anew when she remembered
that the “Amen” was often said for him by the
presiding minister, with such final significance
of intonation, ostentatiously rising the while from
the kneeling posture, as to fix perforce a period
to this prolix incoherency of “prayin’ fur the
power.”</p>

<p>“Ye don’t <i>feel</i> it,” she protested, very cautiously
sobbing, for since her grief would not be denied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
she indulged it under strict guard,—“ye don’t
<i>feel</i> it! But me,—it cuts me like a knife!”</p>

<p>“Why, Phemie,” he said softly, walking closer
to her side,—noticing which she moved nearer
the verge of the stream, that she might keep the
distance between them exactly the same as before,
not that she wished to repel him, but that the demonstration
might escape the notice of those who
followed,—“’pears ter me like ye oughtn’t ter
keer fur the laffin’ an’ mockin’, fur mebbe I’ll be
visited with a outpourin’ o’ the sperit, an’ be
’lowed ter work fur my Lord like I wanter do.”</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him; they had reached
the top of a sort of promontory that jutted out
over a leafy sea of the budding forests on the
levels of the Cove below. The whole world of the
spring was a-blooming. Even the tulip-trees, with
their splendid dignity of height and imposing
girth, seeming well able to spare garlands, wore to
their topmost sprays myriads of red and yellow
bells swaying in the breeze. The azaleas were all
a-blow, and a flowering vine, the merest groundling,
but decked with delicate white corymbs, lay across
the path. The view of the sinking sun was intercepted
by a great purple range, heavy and lowering
of shadow and sombre of hue, but through
the gap toward the west, as if glimpsed through
some massive gate, was visible a splendid irradiation
overspreading the yellow-green valley and the
blue mountains beyond; so vividly azure was this
tint that the color seemed to share the vernal impulse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
and glowed with unparalleled radiance, like
some embellishment of the spring which the grosser
seasons of the year might not compass. From
below, where the beetling rock overhung a wilderness
of rhododendron, voices came up on the soft
air. The others of the party had taken the short
cut. She heard her mother’s wheeze, the juggler’s
low mellow voice, her father’s irritable raucous
response, and she realized that she might speak
without interruption.</p>

<p>“The Lord’s got nuthin’ fur ye,” she averred
vehemently; “he don’t need yer preachin’ an’ he
don’t listen ter yer prayers. Ye hev come ter be
the laffin’-stock o’ the meetin’ an’ the jye o’ the
game-makers o’ the Cove. An’ ef—ef ye don’t
gin it up—I—I—ye’ll hev ter gin me up—one
or t’other—me or that.”</p>

<p>Haines was not slow now. He understood her
in a flash. The covert grin, the scornful titter,
the zestful wink,—she cared more for these small
demonstrations of the unthinkingly merry or the
censorious scoffer than for him or the problematic
work that his Master might send him the grace to
do. Nevertheless, he steadied himself to put this
into words that he might make sure beyond peradventure.
He had taken off his hat. The wind
was blowing back the masses of his fine curling
fair hair from his broad low brow. His cheeks
were flushed, his eyes alight and intense. He
held his head slightly forward. “I must gin you
up, or gin up prayin’ fur the power ter preach?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“Prayin’ in public—’fore the folks—I mean;
in the church-house or at camp-meetin’. Oh, I
can’t marry a man gin over ter sech prayin’ afore
the congregations! but ye kin go off yander alone
in the woods or on the mountings, an’ pray, ef so
minded, till the skies fall, for all I’m keerin’.”</p>

<p>“Ye mind kase people laff,” he said slowly.</p>

<p>“Ef people laff at me kase I be foolish, I mind
it. Ef people laff at me kase <i>they</i> air fools, they
air welcome ter thar laffin’ an’ thar folly too.”
This discrimination was plain. But as he still
looked dreamy and dazed, she made the application
for him. “Ye can’t preach; ye can’t pray;
ye make a idjit o’ yerself tryin’. I can’t marry
no sech man ’thout ye gin up prayin’ ’fore folks.”</p>

<p>“Ye think mo’ o’ folks ’n the Lord?” Haines
demanded, with a touch of that ministerial asperity
expert in imputing sin.</p>

<p>But so widely diffused are the principles of
Christianity that the well-grounded layman can
rarely be silenced even by a minister with a call,
much less poor uncommissioned tongue-tied Owen
Haines.</p>

<p>“The Lord makes allowances which people
can’t an’ won’t,” she retorted. “He hears the
thought an’ the sigh, an’ even the voice of a tear.”</p>

<p>“He does! He does!” cried Owen Haines,
fired by the very suggestion, his face, his eyes, his
lips aflame. “An’ may my tongue cleave to the
roof of my mouth an’ my right hand be withered
an’ forget its cunning, may agues an’ anguish rack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
my body an’ may my mind dwindle ter the sense
of a brute beastis, ef ever I promise ter put bonds
on prayer or eschew the hope of my heart in the
house of God. I’ll pray fur the power—I’ll
pray fur the power ter preach till I lose the gift o’
speech—till I kin say no word but ‘the power!—the
power!—the power’!”</p>

<p>Euphemia cowered before the enthusiasm her
chance phrase had conjured up. She had not, in
a certain sense, doubted the sincerity of her lover’s
religious fervor. She secretly and unconsciously
doubted the validity of any spiritual life. She
could not postulate the sacrificial temperament.
She could not realize how he would have embraced
any votive opportunity. He was of the type akin
to the anchorite, the monastic recluse,—who in
default of aught else offers the kernel of life, if
not its empty shell,—even the martyr. For he
had within him that fiery exaltation which might
have held him stanch at the stake, and lifted his
voice in triumphant psalmody above the roar of
the flames. But although he had had his spiritual
sufferings of denial, and floutings, and painful
patience, and hope that played the juggler with
despair, he had anticipated no ordeal like this.
He looked in her eyes for some token of relenting,
his own full of tears above the hardly quenched
brightness of his fervor of faith, a quiver on his
lips.</p>

<p>Her face was set and stern. With a realization
how deeply the fantasy had struck roots in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
nature, she perceived that she must needs share it
or flee it. She was hardly aware of what she did
mechanically, but as she painstakingly tied the
pink strings of her bonnet under her dimpled chin
it was with an air of finality, of taking leave.
She was not unconscious of a certain pathetic
appeal in his life, seemingly unnoted by God, yet
for God’s service, and rejected by love. But she
thought that if he pitied himself without avail she
need not reproach herself that she did not pity
him more. And truly she had scant pity to spare.
And so he stood there and said “Farewell” as in
a dream, and as in a dream she left him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> created something of a sensation, one morning,
when the juggler—for the mountaineers as
solemnly distinguished him by the name he had
given them of his queer vocation as if it were the
serious profession of law—appeared among the
lime-burners on the slope of the mountain. With
his sensitive perceptions, he could not fail to notice
their paucity of courtesy, the look askance, the
interchanged glances. Singularly obtuse, however,
he must have seemed, for he presently ensconced
himself, with a great show of consideration for his
own comfort, as if for a stay of length, in the sheltered
recess where the lime-burners were seated
at some distance from the fire, for the heat was
searching and oppressive. The heavy shadow of
the cliff protected them from the sun. Below, the
valley was spread out like a map. If one would
have dreams, a sylvan ditty that an unseen stream,
in a deep ravine hard by, was rippling out like a
chime of silver bells swaying in the wayward wind
came now to the ear, and now was silent, and
somehow invited the fantasies of drowsing. Everything
that grew betokened the spring. Even the
great pines which knew no devastation of winter
bore testimony to the vernal impulse, and stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
bedecked with fair young shoots as with a thousand
waxen tapers.</p>

<p>The juggler, lying at full length on the moss,
his hands clasped under his head, watched their
serried ranks all adown the slope, broken here and
there by the high-tinted verdure of the deciduous
trees. He conserved a silence that seemed unintentional
and accidental, perhaps because of his
unconstrained attitude and of his casual expression
of countenance, since he apparently took no note
of the cessation of conversation among the lime-burners
which had supervened on his arrival.</p>

<p>Talk was soon resumed, however, curiosity becoming
a factor.</p>

<p>“Who’s ’tendin’ the pertracted meetin’ down
yander, from Sims’s?” demanded Peter Knowles,
looking at Royce to intimate whom he addressed.</p>

<p>“Only the head of the house,” responded the
juggler: “Tubal Cain, the man of might, himself.”</p>

<p>Peter Knowles still gazed at him with frowning
fixity. “That thar Jane Ann Sims ain’t got no
mo’ religion ’n a Dominicky hen,” he observed.</p>

<p>“Well,” the juggler was fain to contend in a
sentiment of loyalty to the roof that sheltered him,
“she is busy; she has her household duties to look
after.”</p>

<p>“Shucks, ye young buzzard! ye can’t fool me!”
exclaimed Tip Wrothers, in half-jocular triumph.
“Don’t all the Cove know ez Jane Ann Sims don’t
turn a hand ef Phemie’s thar ter do it fur her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“Yaas,” drawled Gideon Beck, “an’ Phemie
ain’t got much mo’ religion ’n her mammy. Jes’
wunst hev she been ’tendin’ on the meetin’,—an’
this air Thursday, an’ the mourners constant, an’
a great awakenin’. Phemie Sims would set the
nangel Gabriel down ter wait in the passage whilst
she war a-polishin’ of her milk-crocks, ef he hed
been sent ter fetch her ter heaven, an’ she warn’t
through her dairy worship.”</p>

<p>“If Mrs. Sims doesn’t turn her hand, there’s
obliged to be somebody there to turn one. We
don’t have any rations of manna served out these
days,” argued the juggler. “It’s well that somebody
stays at home. Tubal Cain and I are enough
church-goers for one house.”</p>

<p>“Air you-uns a mourner?” demanded Beck,
with a sudden accession of interest.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the juggler, “though I’ve lots
and cords to mourn over.” He shifted his position
with a sigh.</p>

<p>Wrothers and Knowles exchanged a significant
glance which Beck did not observe. With a distinct
bridling he said, “<i>I</i> be a perfesser. <i>I</i> hev
been a perfesser fur the past ten year.”</p>

<p>“It must be a great satisfaction,” responded the
juggler.</p>

<p>It was something, however, which he did not
envy, and this fact was so patent that it roused the
rancor of Beck. One of the dearest delights of
possession is often the impotent grudging of him
who hath not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>The juggler, despite his assured demeanor, had
reverted to that sense of discomfort which had
earlier beset him when he went abroad in the Cove.
In the church he had marked a certain agitated
curiosity as members of the congregation who had
been at the “show” recognized the man who was
deemed so indisputably in league with Satan. But
this was merged in the fast accumulating interest
of the meetings, and upon a second attendance,
barring that he was here and there covertly
pointed out to wide-eyed newcomers, denizens of
further heights and more retired dells, his entrance
scarcely made a ripple of excitement. This he
accounted eminently satisfactory. It had been his
intention to accustom the mountaineers to the
sight of him, to have his accomplishments as a
prestidigitator grow stale as a story that is told, to
be looked upon as a familiar and a member of
the Sims household; all this favored his disguise
and his escape from notoriety and question. He
had been prepared for the surprise and curiosity
which the presence of a stranger in so secluded a
region naturally excites. Since learning somewhat
of the superstitions and distorted religious ideas
which prevailed among so ignorant and sequestered
a people, he could even understand their fear of
his simple feats of legerdemain, and the referring
of the capacity to work these seeming miracles to
collusion with the devil. But altogether different,
mysterious, threatening, unnerving, was the keen
inimical vigilance which he discerned in Peter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
Knowles’s eye; the sense of some withheld
thought, some unimagined expectation, which might
be apprehended yet not divined, roused afresh the
terror of detection which had begun to slumber
in the security of this haven with its new life
and absolute death to the old world. As the juggler
lay on his back, with his eyes fixed on that
deep blue sky of May, fringed about with the
fibrous pines above his head, he tried to elucidate
the problem. Something alien, something dangerous,
something removed it was from the fantasies
of the ignorant mountaineers. But for all his
keenness and his long training in the haunts of
men, for all his close observation and his habit of
just deduction, that thin-lipped, narrow, ascetic visage
gave him no inkling what this withheld thought
might be,—how it could be elicited, met, thwarted.
Only one gleam of significance from the eye he
interpreted, a distinct note of interrogation. Whatever
the expectation might be, to whatever it might
be leading, it was not devoid of uncertainty and
of involuntary inquiry.</p>

<p>He attempted to reassure himself. He tried to
argue that it was only his consciousness surcharged
with its weighty secret which made him flinch
when any questioning eye was turned upon him.
What could this mountaineer, ignorant and inexperienced
as the rest, divine or suspect,—how
could he dream of the truth?</p>

<p>And yet, so much was at stake: his liberty, his
name, his honor,—nay, the sheerest commercial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
honesty. And so far all had gone well! He
clung now to his fictitious death as if the prospect
of this existence in the Cove had not well-nigh
made it real, so had his heart sunk within him at
the thought of the future. He said to himself
sharply that he would not be brought to bay by
this clumsy schemer. Surely he could meet craft
with craft. The old habit of transacting business
had no doubt sufficed to keep his countenance
impassive, and he would set himself to add to the
little they knew circumstances of which they did
not dream, well calculated to baffle preconceived
theories.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not a mourner,” he replied to Beck’s
sanctimonious gaze,—“not much! The kind of
sinner I am goes to meeting to see the girls.”</p>

<p>A momentary silence ensued. Not that this
pernicious motive for seeking the house of worship
was unheard of in Etowah Cove. There as elsewhere
it was a very usual symptom of original sin.
Few saints, however indurated by holiness against
such perversion of the obvious uses of the sanctuary,
but could remember certain soft and callow
days when the theme of salvation held forth no
greater reward than the occupancy of crowded back
benches and the unrestricted gaze of round young
eyes. It was, nevertheless, a motive so contrary
to the suspicion which Knowles and Sims himself
had entertained of the juggler’s sojourn here and
had grafted on the credulity of their cronies,—a
lightsome motive, so incompatible with the grisly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
suggestions of murder, and flight from justice, and
the expectation of capture and condign punishment,—that
it could not be at first assimilated
with his supposed identity as a fugitive and criminal.
His sudden unaccounted-for presence here,
the unexplained prolonged stay, the report of the
silent preoccupied hours which he spent on the
ledges over the river, fishing with an unbaited hook,
the troubled silence, the answers at haphazard, the
pallid languid apparition after sleepless nights,
and, more than all, the agonized cries from out the
feigned miseries of dreams, all tallied fairly and
justified the theory built upon them. But this
new element interjected so abruptly had a disintegrating
subversive effect.</p>

<p>“Waal, ain’t all the gals in the kentry mighty
nigh down yander at the meetin’ now?” demanded
Beck.</p>

<p>He spoke mechanically, for he had lost sight of
his effort to induce the juggler to attend upon the
means of grace, if ever he had seriously entertained
it, and he would not, on sober reflection, have
offered this frivolous inducement as a loadstone to
draw the reluctant heavenward,—let perdition
seize him first!</p>

<p>“Plenty there, no doubt,” said the juggler
uncommunicatively, as if having taken counsel
within himself.</p>

<p>Old Josiah Cobbs chuckled knowingly, as he sat
on the stump of the tree which he most affected
and nursed his knee. “The <i>right one</i> ain’t thar,—that’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
the hitch! All the gals but one, an’
that one wuth all the rest, hey?” He chuckled
once more, thinking he was peculiarly keen-witted
to spy out the secret of the juggler’s indifference
to prayer and praise. He perceived naught of the
subtler significance of the disclosure, and easily quitting
the subject he turned his head as if to listen.</p>

<p>The sound of the hymning rose suddenly on the
breeze. From far away it was, if one must mete
out the distance by the windings of the red clay
road and the miles of fragrant springtide woods
that intervened. But the music came straight
through the air like the winged thing it is. And
now it soared in solemn jubilance, and now it sank
with soft fluctuations, and presently he recognized
the tune and fell to humming it in unison with
that far-away worship and with that air of soft
pleasure in the religious cadences which one may
often see in the aged, and which suggests the idea
that in growing old hymns become as folk-song on
the lips of the returning exile, and in every inflection
is the rapture of going home.</p>

<p>The others neither heard nor heeded. They
reminded Lucien Royce, as they were grouped
around him,—some standing, some sitting or
reclining on the mossy rocks in the flickering
shade, but every eye fixed speculatively on him,—of
that fable in many tongues wherein the beasts
of the field find a sleeping man and hold a congress
to determine the genus of the animal, his capacities
and utilities. He looked as inadvertent as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
could, and but for the jeopardy of all he held dear
he might have discovered in the situation food for
mirth.</p>

<p>Jack Ormsby, who had not spoken heretofore,
sat with a great clasp-knife in his hand whittling
into thin slivers a bit of the bird’s-eye maple that
lay prone on the ground as if it had no better uses
in manufacture than to furnish fuel to burn lime.
He suddenly said, regardless of the possible inference
and with a certain surly emphasis, “I hev
hearn tell ez Euphemia Sims air a-goin’ ter marry
Owen Haines.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it!” cried the juggler.</p>

<p>Swift significant glances were exchanged among
the others as he pulled himself into a sitting posture
and looked with challenging controversy at
Ormsby. The young mountaineer seemed surprised
at this direct demonstration.</p>

<p>“They hev been keepin’ comp’ny cornsider’ble,
ennyhow,” he persisted.</p>

<p>“Let bygones be bygones,” the juggler said,
with his wonted easy flippancy.</p>

<p>Old Cobbs rejoiced in the idea of love-making in
the abstract. He had not realized who was the
girl whose absence apparently rendered the crowded
church but a barren desert. He only apprehended
that one of the disputants advanced the possibility
of a future marriage which the other denied. He
sided at once with conjugal bliss.</p>

<p>“I reckon it must be true,” he urged. “Thar
ain’t nuthin’ ter be said agin it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“Except he’s a fool!” exclaimed the juggler,
with rancor.</p>

<p>“Ye mean ’bout prayin’ fur the power?” asked
Beck.</p>

<p>“A tremendous fool! He can’t preach. He
hasn’t the endowment, the gift of the gab. He
has no call from above or below.”</p>

<p>Royce felt no antagonism toward the man, and he
realized that they all shared his standpoint, but he
was not ill pleased that he should seem to be jealously
decrying Euphemia’s lover.</p>

<p>“Phemie don’t ’low he be a fool, I’ll be
bound,” said old Cobbs. “I hev viewed a many a
man ’counted a puffick idjit, mighty nigh, at the
sto’ an’ the blacksmith shop, yit at home ’mongst
his wimminfolks he be a mo’ splendugious pusson
’n the President o’ the Nunited States.”</p>

<p>“I reckon Jack’s right,” remarked Beck. “I
reckon they’ll marry.” This stroke, he reflected
with satisfaction, cut not only the juggler, but
Ormsby also, notwithstanding the fact that it was
the theory advanced by the young mountaineer
himself.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet my hat they don’t,” declared the juggler
eagerly.</p>

<p>This suggestion of superior knowledge, of certainty,
on the part of a stranger angered Jack
Ormsby, who vibrated between his red-hot jealousy
of the juggler on one side and of Owen Haines on
the other.</p>

<p>“We-uns know Phemie Sims better’n ye do!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
he said, as if this were an argument despite the
chameleon-hued changes of the feminine mind.
“Ye never seen her till ye kem ter Etowah Cove.”</p>

<p>“How do you know I didn’t?” retorted the
juggler warily. He sat leaning forward, his hat in
his hand; his hair, grown longer than its wont,
was crumpled on his forehead; he looked at Ormsby
with a glitter of triumph in his red-brown eyes.</p>

<p>“Whar’d ye kem from jes’ afore ye got hyar?”
demanded Ormsby huskily.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why you are so inquisitive, my
son,” returned the juggler, airily flouting, “but
since you wish to know—from Piomingo Cove.”</p>

<p>This was true in a literal sense. Since he had
been here, and had sought, with that instinct natural
to civilized people, to grasp the details of the
surrounding country,—some specimens of the
genus not being able to sleep until the points of
the compass are satisfactorily indicated and arranged
in their well-regulated minds,—he had
learned that the rugged valley which he had
traversed, with only another cove intervening before
he reached Etowah, was Piomingo Cove. They all
remembered Euphemia’s recent visit there. The
inference was but too plain. He had doubtless
seen her at her grandmother’s house down in Piomingo
Cove, and, fascinated by her beauty and
charm, he had followed her here. And here he
lingered,—what so natural! A proud, headstrong
maiden like Euphemia was not to be won in a day;
and should he leave her, with Jack Ormsby and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
Owen Haines inciting each other to haste and
urgency, were matters likely to remain until his
return as they were now? Most of the lime-burners’
clique never hereafter believed aught but
that this was the solution of the mystery of the juggler’s
sojourn in Etowah Cove.</p>

<p>Royce went down the mountain flushed with victory.
He had descried a strong and favorable
revolution in popular sentiment toward him, and
the duty nearest at hand was to make the illusion
true and lay siege to the heart of Euphemia.</p>

<p>He was not concerned as to how his wooing
should speed. It was only essential that it should
be a demonstration sufficiently marked to justify his
lingering presence here and sustain the impression
which he had made on the lime-burners. He said
this again and again to himself, to appease a certain
repugnance which he began to experience
when the idea with which he had lightly played
became a definite and constraining course of action.
He remembered that in reverie he had even gone
so far as to canvass the disguise which marriage
might afford, settling him here permanently as if
he were a native, and, as time should pass, lessening
daily the chance of the detection of his identity
and of his life heretofore. He realized that for the
next twenty years this discovery would be impending
at any moment. He had a great respect for the
truth as truth, and its inherent capacity for prevailing;
and this led him to fear it the more. A lie has
so fatal a proclivity to collapse. He had often told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
himself that it was the part of policy to accept life
here as one of the mountaineers, content with their
portion of the good things vouchsafed, the brand of
undeserved shame evaded, the hardship of ignominious
imprisonment eluded, the struggle of poverty
reduced to its minimum in this Arcadian
existence; for sometimes he realized anew, with
a half-dazed sense, that the old life was indeed
gone forever,—if for naught else, by reason of
his financial losses in the collapse of the firm of
Greenhalge, Gould &amp; Fife.</p>

<p>He now stipulated within himself, however, that
this was to be only a feint of love-making,—a
flirtation, he would have termed it, were it to be
illumined by wax candles, or the electric light,
or gas, in lieu of the guttering tallow dip. He
adduced with a sense of protection—and he could
not forbear a laugh at himself and his sudden terrors—the
certainty with which he had cause to
know that the heart of the fair daughter of the
miller was already bestowed on the young “crank,”
as he called the man “who was fool enough to pray
for what he wanted.” Yet for all it was to be
only a mere semblance of capture, he could but be
dubious of these chains with which he was about
to invest himself of deliberate intention; heretofore
he had fallen headlong in love and headlong out,
and would not have shackled himself of his own
volition. Thus he rattled Cupid’s fetters tentatively,
timorously, judging of their weight, and
with a wish to be safely out of them as well as
swiftly into them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>It was but a feint, he reassured himself. On her
part, she would have an additional conquest to
boast of; and as to him, all the world—of Etowah
Cove—would see with what grace he would “wear
the willow-tree.”</p>

<p>“Since Phyllis hath forsaken me!” he sang
airily, as he made his way down the sharp declivity.</p>

<p>Never in all his mental exercitations did he
dream of difficulty in conveying to her intelligence
an intimation of the supposed state of his heart.
It had been his experience that such intimations
are like spontaneous combustion: they take fire
from no appreciable provocation. Nay, he had
known of many wills-o’-the-wisp in this sort, suggesting
flame where there was no fire, for it is a
trait of the feminine creature to often overrate the
power of her charms, and to predicate desolation
therefrom in altogether thriving insensible hearts.
But perhaps because of her absorption Euphemia
took no notice of a certain change in his manner
toward her, which had been heretofore incidental
and non-committal and inexpressive. Mrs. Sims,
however, with that alertness to which the meddler
in other people’s love affairs is ever prone, marked
it with inward perturbation, lest it should attract
the attention of Tubal Cain Sims, whose evident
antagonism to the juggler she had ascribed merely
to a perverse humor. From the beginning, however,
Royce had found especial favor in her eyes,—at
first because he was so travel-worn and rain-soaked,
and fevered and exhausted. Mrs. Sims<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
had not experienced such solicitude since her only
child was an ailing infant. Although he disproved
her diagnosis of his illness and her arbitrary plans
of treatment by appearing fresh and well the next
morning, as if he had been newly created, she forgave
him his recovery, and liked him because he
was so strong and handsome and pleasant-spoken,
and in some vague way, to her groping inexperienced
realization of the various strata of human
beings, so different, and so superior, and so capable
of appreciating the wonderful Euphemia that
he was really to be accounted worthy of the relenting
of fate which permitted him to see her. After
Euphemia’s return Mrs. Sims suffered a certain
disappointment that the young people took such
scant notice of each other in coming and going the
household ways, and she was wont to console herself
now and then by contemplating them furtively
as they sat opposite, one on each side of the table,
and fetching the fattest of her sighs to think what
a handsome couple they would make! She remembered,
however, as in duty bound, Owen
Haines, and perhaps she drew from this consciousness
deeper sighs than either of the young lovers
could have furnished to any occasion. She was
not so proud as Euphemia, and she thought that if
the Lord visited no judgment on Owen Haines for
his pertinacity in praying for the power, his fellow
saints or fellow sinners—whichever they might
be most appropriately called—ought to be able to
endure the ten minutes wasted in the experiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
to win the consent of Heaven. But she wished
that her prospective son-in-law could be more practical
of mind. She realized that Haines was
dreamy, and that his spiritual aspirations were
destined to be thwarted. They had sent deep
roots into his nature, and she fancied that she
could foresee the effect on his later years,—years
pallid, listless, forever yearning after a spiritual
fantasy always denied; forever reaching backward
with regret for the past wasted in an unasked and
seemingly a spurned service. Her motherly heart
went out to Owen Haines, and she would fain
have coddled him out of his—religion, was it?
She did not know; she could not argue.</p>

<p>But Euphemia was her only child, and it is not
necessary that the materials shall be ivory and
gold and curious inlay to enable a zealous worshiper
to set up an idol. Mrs. Sims looked into
the juggler’s handsome face with its alert eyes and
blithe mundane expression, and as proxy she loved
him so heartily that she did not doubt his past,
nor carp at his future, nor question his motives.
The fact of his lingering here so long—for he
had asked only a night’s lodging, and afterward
had taken board by the week—occurred to her
more than once as a symptom of a sentimental
interest in Euphemia; for otherwise why did he
not betake himself about his affairs? This theory
had languished recently, since naught developed
to support it.</p>

<p>Now when she began to suspect that this vicarious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
sentiment of hers on Euphemia’s account was
about to meet a return, Mrs. Sims’s heart was all
a-flutter with anxiety and pity and secret exultation.
One moment she trembled lest Euphemia
should mark the thoughtful silent scrutiny of
which she was the subject, but when she chanced to
lift her long-lashed eyes, the juggler reddened suddenly,
averted his own, and drank his coffee scalding
hot. Euphemia evidently was oblivious of him,
and Mrs. Sims became wroth within her amiable-seeming
mask, and said to herself that she would
as soon have a dough child, since one could “take
notice ez peart ez Phemie.” Perhaps because of
Mrs. Sims’s superabundant flesh, which rendered
her of a quiescent appearance, however active her
interest, and perhaps because she did not appeal
in any manner to the ungrateful juggler’s hypercritical
and finical prepossessions, he had no subtle
intimations that she was cognizant in a degree
of his mental processes, and had noted the fact
of the frequent serious dwelling of his eyes, and
manifestly his thoughts, upon Euphemia.</p>

<p>The girl had never been so beautiful as now. In
these later days, that saddened pride which at once
subdued and sustained her added a dignity to her
expression of which earlier it would have been
incapable. It spiritualized her exquisite eyes; so
often downcast they were and so slowly lifted that
the length of the thick dark lashes affected the
observer as a hitherto unnoted element of beauty.
Her eyes always had a certain look of expectation,—now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
starlike as with the radiance of renewing
hope, now pathetic and full of shadows. It seemed
to the juggler, unconsciously sympathetic, that
those incomparable eyes might have conjured the
man bodily into the road where they looked so
wistfully to see him, so vainly.</p>

<p>“Confound the fellow!” he said to himself.
“Why doesn’t he come? I’d like to hale him
here by the long hair of that tow-head of his—if
she wants to see him.” And his heart glowed
with resentment against poor Owen Haines, who
thought in his folly that a woman’s “No” is to be
classed among the recognized forms of negation,
and was realizing on far Chilhowee all the bitterness
of rejected love and denied prayers.</p>

<p>After a while Royce despaired of drawing her
attention to himself,—he who had been in his
own circle the cynosure of all youthful eyes.
“There’s nothing in the world so stupid as a girl
in love,” he moralized, irritated at last.</p>

<p>This state of unwilling obscurity developed in
him a degree of perversity. He was prepared to
assume an attitude of lowly admiration, of humble
subservience, the kiss-the-hem-of-your-robe-save-for-the-foolishness-of-it
sort of look which might impress
her and the rest of the Sims family and all
admiring spectators with the fact of how stuck
full of Cupid’s arrows he had now become. But
no man can play the rôle of lover, however lamely,
when the lady of his adoration notices him no
more than a piece of furniture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>As he went through the passage one day, she
happened to be there alone, tilted back in her
chair against the wall, her small feet upon one of
the rungs, her curls stirring in the breeze, droning
laboriously aloud from the Third Reader, the
pride and limit of her achievement.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said cavalierly, reaching out and
taking the book quickly from her hand, “let me
show you how <i>I</i> read that.”</p>

<p>Now elocution had been one of the versatile juggler’s
chief accomplishments. He read the simple
stanzas in a style of much finish. His voice was of
a quality smooth as velvet, and his power of enunciation
had been trained to that degree that its
cultivation was apparent only in the results, and
might have seemed a natural endowment, so scantily
was the idea of effort suggested. His special
and individual capacity lay in the subtle inflections
of tone, which elicited from the verses meanings
hitherto undreamed-of by her. It was as if a
stone had been flung into still water. Above these
suddenly interjected new interpretations the circles
of thought widened from one elastic remove to
another, and Euphemia sat dazed in the contemplation
of these diverse whorls and concentric convolutions
of the obvious idea. She said nothing as he
handed back the book with an elaborate ballroom
bow, but gazed up at him with an absorbed, serious
face, all softened and gently appealing like a bewildered
child’s, and then fixed her eyes intently
upon the page, as if seeking to find and hold those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
transient illusions of fickle fancy that had glimmered
so alluringly through the plain, manifest
text. He left her thus as he put on his hat and
stepped out upon the path leading down the slope.
He glanced back once, to see her still sitting there,
motionless but for the wind which swayed the fair
loosely curled hair of her bent head and the folds
of her faint green dress as it did the sprays of the
vines on the opposite side of the passage, which
grew so thick that they formed a dark background
for her figure in the cool shadowy green dusk;
otherwise he might not have been able to distinguish
it from out the glare and glister of the open sunny
space where he stood. He gazed unobserved for a
moment; then he turned and went on in much dissatisfaction
of spirit. It was no way, he argued
within himself, to assume the character of a lovesick
swain by demonstrating his superiority to the fair
maiden,—to flout her poor and painful efforts by
the exhibition of his glib accomplishment. “I
must needs always have an audience,—be always
exhibiting my various feats and knacks. I was
born a juggler,” he said ruefully.</p>

<p>But that evening when they sat at supper,—much
later than usual, since the favorite Spot had
wandered far into the forest, and did not return till
she was sought and found and driven reluctantly
home, with many pauses by the way,—the furtive
glances across the table did not emigrate from his
side of it. The meal was served in the main room
of the cabin, to avoid the cloud of moths which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
light outside in the passage would attract. In the
white, languid, dispirited glow of the tallow dip
the furnishings of the apartment were but dimly
visible. Now and again the flicker of the wind set
astir the pendent strings of pepper and bunches of
dried herbs and various indiscriminate gear that
swung from the beams. The red embers where
the supper had been cooked were spread apart
on the hearth that the heat might be lessened, and
here and there through the white efflorescence of
the ash only a tinge of the vermilion hues of the
coals could be discerned. Despite its subdued red
glare the failing fire had little irradiating effect,
and added scantily to the cheer of the apartment.
The batten shutter flapped back and forth with a
wooden clamor; the wind had brought clouds and
rain impended, and Tubal Cain Sims’s corn was
not yet all planted, and the ground would probably
be too wet to plough for a week or more. Grum
and indignant because of this possible dispensation
of Providence, he sat in his shirt-sleeves, with his
shock head bent, only looking up from under his
grizzled shaggy eyebrows to discern in the glimmer
of the candle the food he wanted, and only speaking
to growl for it. The one crumb of comfort he
coveted was denied him. A certain johnny-cake
had burnt up “bodaciously” on its board as it
baked before the fire, and it would seem that Tubal
Cain Sims, from his youth up, had subsisted
solely on the hope of this most dainty of rural
cates, so surlily did he receive the news, and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
solemnly did he demand to be told how in the
name of Moses a cake that never was put near the
fire, but baked by the heat thrown on the hearth,
could be reduced to cinders.</p>

<p>“Witched somehows, I reckon,” suggested Mrs.
Sims easily; and since argument could not move
that massive lady, Tubal Cain resorted to silent
sulks, not in the vain hope of shaking her equilibrium,
but for the sake of their own solace to the
affronted spirit.</p>

<p>Although this disaster chanced within Euphemia’s
own jurisdiction and beneath her presidial
care, she took no part in the spirited colloquy on
the subject, but seemed absorbed in thought, ever
and anon casting a covert look at the young man.
As of late he had fallen into the habit, with the
opportunity afforded at meal-times, of contemplating
her with swift and furtive glances, more than
once their eyes met, to the visible embarrassment
of both; the juggler, to his astonishment, coloring
furiously as might any country boy, and a touch of
surprise and almost inquiry becoming visible in the
eyes of Euphemia. Strange that so poor and primitive
a contrivance as a pallid tallow dip could set
such stars of radiant beauty in those long-lashed
pensive orbs. They looked bewilderingly lovely to
the young man as they were suddenly fixed upon
him, intent with the first intimation of personal interest
which he had ever discerned in their depths.</p>

<p>“How long hev you-uns hed schoolin’?” she
demanded abruptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“Schooling? I? Oh yes. From the time I was
six years old till I was twenty-two,” he replied.</p>

<p>Her face was a study of amazement. “Did
school keep reg’lar all them years in the cove whar
you-uns lived?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, school kept as regular as taxes.” He
had half a mind to explain that it was not always
the same institution which had the honor of training
his youthful faculties, and to enumerate the
various gradations which had their share in his
proficiency, from the kindergarten, and the grammar
school, to the academic and collegiate career;
but he stopped short, reflecting that this might
result in self-betrayal in some sort.</p>

<p>Her mind was at work. Her eyes and face were
troubled. “We-uns hev hed school in the Cove
two years consider’ble time ago,” she remarked.
“They ’low the money air short, somehows.”</p>

<p>“That ain’t no differ ter we-uns,” said Mrs.
Sims cheerily. “Phemie l’arned all thar is ter
know.”</p>

<p>Even old Tubal Cain threw off dull care for a
moment and vouchsafed a prideful refrain: “I
’lowed the chile would put out her eyes studyin’
an’ readin’ so constant, but she hev got her eyesight
and her l’arnin’ too.”</p>

<p>But Phemie’s face was flushed with a sudden
painful glow. “I ain’t got ez much ez some,” she
faltered, her head drooping slightly.</p>

<p>In the midst of the clamor of denial of any
greater possible proficiency, from the two old people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
who had not heard the juggler’s reading during
the afternoon, she involuntarily cast upon him so
appealing, so disarming a glance that for once he
was ashamed to even secretly laugh at them.</p>

<p>“If it’s erudition that goes,” he said afterward,
lighting his pipe under the stars and finding the
grace to laugh instead at himself, “I am the
learned man to suit the occasion.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Euphemia’s</span> interest did not relax. What
strange perversity of fate was it that this little
clod of humanity, so humbly placed, upon the very
ground of existence, as it were, should have been
instinct with that high, keen, fine appreciation of
learning for its own sake?—for she knew naught
of its more sordid rewards, and could not have
dreamed that the relative estimation of these
values, even by those of happiest opportunities,
is often reversed, the reward making the worth of
the learning. She did not realize an aspiration.
Her wings simply fluttered because she felt the
impulse to rise. Royce could not have conceived
of aught more densely ignorant. He had known
no mind more naturally intelligent. Its acquisitiveness
hardly differentiated its objects; it only
grasped them. The Third Reader bade fair to become
a burden. He could scarcely put his foot on
the sill of the passage before he heard the flutter of
its leaves, and the much-thumbed, dog-eared old
volume was offered to his hand with the restrained
enthusiasm of the remark, “Ye’ll hev time ter read
a piece afore dinner,” or supper, or bedtime, as the
case might be. There was a certain embarrassment
in these symposia. Mrs. Sims, it is true, looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
on smilingly, with her vicarious affection shining
in her eyes, but a chance question developed the
fact that she understood hardly one word out of
ten, the vocabulary of ignorance being of most
constricting limitations; while Tubal Sims openly
and gruffly sneered down the performance, tossing
his shock head at every conclusion, and protesting
that the young man read so fast, an’ with so many
ups an’ downs, an’ with such a clippin’ an’ bob-tailin’
of his words that it was plumb ridic’lous.
For him, give him good Scriptur’ readin’, slow an’
percise, like the l’arned men in the pul-<i>pit</i>. Did
Pa’son Tynes read in that flibberty-gibberty way?
He reckoned not. And he wagged his head as if
he would fain take his oath on that, the spirit of
affirmation so possessed him. Moreover, Royce
did not consider this Third Reader a particularly
meritorious compilation; he often flung its pages
back and forth in vain search of a satisfactory
selection, and doubtless would have declined to
waste the merits of his rendering on the least vapid
had it not been for the submissive, expectant face
of Euphemia, as she sat waiting in her chair, bolt
upright, school-wise, with her hands clasped in her
lap, the subdued radiance of her eyes capable of
making a much wiser man do a more foolish thing.
For his own sake—he did not dream of the possibility
of the development of her taste—he would
fain have had a wider choice that his delicate perceptions
might suffer no despite, and one day he
bethought himself of the resources of memory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
The young people were both down at the mill.
Some domestic errand had brought Euphemia
there, and he chanced to be on a ledge near at
hand languidly essaying to fish. He asked her a
question touching the further course of the stream
and the locality of a notable fishing-ground further
down. As she replied, she paused and stood expectantly
in the doorway, dangling her green sunbonnet
by the string.</p>

<p>The mill was silent, as was its wont; the afternoon
sunlight glinted through the dense laurel and
the sparse spring foliage of the deciduous trees;
the great cliff on a ledge of which Royce was
standing beetled above the smooth flow of the
stream. Many a fissure broke the massive walls
of stone; here herbage grew and vines swung, and
the mould was moist and fragrant; the perfume of
the wild cherry tree in a niche on the summit filled
all the air. Close by, a great sycamore which had
fallen in a storm stretched from one bank to the
other: its white bark and bare branches were reflected
in the clear water with wondrous fidelity;
even a redbird with his tufted crest, as he fluttered
and strutted up and down the white boughs, now
and again uttering sharp cries of alarm; and even
a nest in a crotch, and his sober-hued little brown-feathered
mate with her head, devoid of any decoration
in the way of unnecessary and vainglorious
tufts, stretched far out in anxiety and trembling.</p>

<p>Euphemia pointed out these reflections in the
water, and after another long pause, “Ef we-uns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
hed the book now, ye could read,” she sighed regretfully.</p>

<p>He played his line negligently; he cast his eyes
to the far, far sky, as if his memory dwelt on high.
Then he began to recite. The wind stirred in the
trees; on the dark lustrous water a shimmer of
sunshine fluctuated like some ethereal golden mesh.
Once, the joy of spring and the bliss of love and
the buoyancy of life overcame the fear in the redbird’s
heart, and he sang out suddenly, as if he
too would have to do with the poetry of thought
and the melody of utterance, and the little brown
bird in the nest listened in admiring silence. All
the time Royce was conscious of Euphemia’s
amazed eyes on his face; when he had finished he
could scarce trust himself to meet the mute rapture
of her gaze. He looked down at his futile line
dragging on the water, and among the sounds of
the sibilantly lapsing currents and the leaves
wafted by the wind he heard her long-drawn sigh
of the relaxing of the tension of delight, and he
turned and met her eyes with a laugh in his own
in which there was only a gentle mirth.</p>

<p>After this he had no peace. He was reminded
of the importunacy of juvenile consumers of stories,
whose interest seems whetted by the incapacity
to read and thus purvey romance for their
own delectation. He found it conducive to his
entertainment to relapse into prose, and he rehearsed
many a work of fiction from memory, failing
seldom of the details, but in such lapses as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
must needs come boldly supplying the deficit by
invention. It is true that in these recitals Euphemia
was debarred the graces of the style of the
authors, but then the juggler thought he had a
very good style of his own. All this involved long
digressions, historical, geographical, astronomical,
political, to explain the status of the personnel or
the <i>locus in quo</i>; and while he talked her eyes
never left his face. He had a habit of looking
straight at his interlocutor, whoever this might be,
and it was thus, perhaps, that he could with such
distinctness conjure the image of those eyes of
hers upon the retina of his mind at moments of
darkness or absence or reverie, as he would. Much
that he said she could not at first comprehend, and
again he was reminded of the inquisitors of the
nursery in the multitude and unsparingness of her
questions; only, so searching and keen and apt
were these that sometimes there was an experience
of surprise and pleasure on his part.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Phemie,” he said one day, “you
are most awfully clever to have seen that.”</p>

<p>The blood rushed to her cheeks in the joy, the
triumph, of his commendation. Pride, the love of
preëminence, the possession of worthy endowment,—these
sentiments were her soul, the ethereal
essence of her life. She had no definite ambition;
she had no definite mental paths. She had groped
in the primeval wildernesses of mind, as if there
had been no splendid line of pioneers who had
blazed out a road for all the centuries to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>In the midst of his utter idleness, in the turmoil
of his troublous thoughts, this review of the literature
that had been dear to him was at first a resource
and a distraction, and later it became a
luxury. He began to be only less eager than she
to resume the discourse where it had left off.
Thus it was that he joined her in sundry domestic
duties, so that while mechanically busy they might
be mentally free, in Scotland, or Norway, or Russia,
or on the wild, wild seas. He was wont to go
with her to drive up the cows; and surely never
in such company did the old fancies tread this New
World soil,—knights in armor and ladies fair and
all the glittering hordes of chivalry crowding the
narrow aisles of the wilderness, and following hard
the fairies and demons of many an antique legend.
Once on the summit of a crag he looked out upon
the world beyond the Cove, for the first time
since his arrival here. Fair, oh, very fair it was,
in the yellow haze of the declining springtide sunshine,
and far it stretched in promissory lengths,
like all the vague possibilities of the future. Parallel
with the massive green heights near at hand ran
others growing amethystine of hue, showing many
a gray cliff and many a gleam of silver mountain
streams winding amongst the divergent spurs and
ravines and coves. Beyond lay the levels of a great
valley, and here were brown stretches of ploughed
fields, and here gleamed the emerald of winter
wheat, and here swept the splendid free curves of
the Tennessee River, flowing the color of burnished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
copper, so did the sunlight idealize the hue of the
spring floods, between the keen high tints of the
green foliage fringing its banks where the rocks
failed. To the north a thousand minor ridges
continued the parallelism which marks the great
mountain system, and these were azure of an indescribably
exquisite and languorous shade, rising
into a silver haze that was itself like an illumination.
And where it seemed that the limits of vision
must surely be reached, the abrupt steeps of the
eastern side of Walden’s Ridge, stretching diagonally
across the whole breadth of the State, shadowy
purple, reflecting naught of the sunset, rose
against the west, and there the sun, all alive with
scarlet fire, was tending downward, with only one
vermilion flake of a cloud in all the blue and
pearly-green and amber crystal sky. He paused
on the verge of the cliff and gazed at it all, while
she stood and looked expectantly at him. Perhaps
with her woman’s intuition she divined that this
moment was in some sort a crisis in his mind.
She was inexplicably agitated, breathless. But as
he gazed his heart did not stir the faster. Here
and there he marked a brilliant slant of glitter
where a steeple caught the sun, now to the north
and again to the southwest, beyond a space a hand
might seem to cover, but which he knew measured
fifty or a hundred miles. These indicated towns.
There beat the full pulses of the life he had left;
and still at sight of them his heart did not plunge.
He looked down at her with an expression in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
eyes all new to them and which she could not
interpret. Nevertheless it set her happy heart
a-flutter. Nothing was said of the view, and with
one accord they sat down on the verge of the cliff.
His boots dangled over the sheer spaces a thousand
feet below, but he could not repress a shiver at
her attitude as she leaned over the brink of the
precipice.</p>

<p>“I wish you would move farther back from the
edge,” he said, with a corrugated brow. “I am
afraid you may slip over, you are so little, and”—</p>

<p>“That would put an e-end to the readings
mighty quick,” she said, as she still leaned over to
peer down at the tops of the trees in the valley,
and he turned sick and dizzy at her very gesture.
He hardly dared to speak lest an unconsidered
word might flutter her nerves and cause her to
lose her hold. She had no intention of thus teasing
his vicarious fright, but drew back presently
to a safe distance. “Wouldn’t it?” she asked,
recurring to her remark as she executed this manœuvre.</p>

<p>“You mean if you should slip over into this
dreadful abyss? I should never, never have the
heart to read another word as long as I should
live!” he protested.</p>

<p>He caught the look of exultant joy in her surprised
and widely opened eyes for one moment,
and then she turned them discreetly on the splendid
vastness of that great landscape in its happiest
mood. He realized that she had no difficulty in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
comprehending the obvious inference. Her experience
as a rural beauty and belle heretofore had
doubtless served to acquaint her with the hyperbole
of a lover’s language. There were Haines
and Ormsby within his own knowledge, and he
could not guess how many suitors hitherto,—confound
them all! he muttered as he thought of
them. He had not intended to win her heart. In
view of her feeling for Owen Haines he had not
deemed it possible. With the suspicion, which he
would fain call realization, for it had all the importunacy
of hope, he experienced a rush of elation,
of soft delight, which amazed him, while it
almost swept him off his feet. Had not he too
fallen in love during his “readings”?—for thus
they both called his recitals. He knew that he
had only to look into her eyes to make his heart
flutter; but then it was a susceptible heart and
easily stirred. She had grown dear to him in
many ways, and he had learned this even when he
did not dream of other result of their companionship
than the broadcast impression that he lingered
here for her sake. He began to strive to separate
his ideal of womanhood from those merely arbitrary
values which fashion and artificial life bestow.
Is it a French man milliner only who establishes
the criterion of beauty? He had but to
glance at the face and form beside him. She was
beautiful; she was good; she was of a singularly
strong and individual character; her natural mind
was quick and retentive and discerning, and of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
remarkable aptness. She was so endowed with a
keen perception of real excellence that knowledge
had but to open its doors to her, for she possessed
as a gift the capacity of worthy choice. She loved
with spontaneous affection those things which other
people are trained to love; she seized on the best
of her own devout accord, unaware of aught of
significance save her own preference. She could
easily acquire all he could teach her. With her
quick grasp and greed of learning there would
soon be little disparity. He began to meditate on
the arbitrary methods of appraisement in the
world. How sadly do we richly rate, not our own
preference, but that which is valued by others:
hence the vyings, the heart-burnings, the ignoble
strife, the false pride, of many mundane miseries.
He knew her real identity. Her nature would
befit any station. Her beauty,—even the reference
to the immutable standards of his own world
could avail no detraction here,—it was preëminent.
Having lived his life in one sphere, why
should he, being dead to it forever, let its rigid
conventionalities follow him into his new world?
As to the coming years and the monotony of
rounding out a long life in this narrow circuit, let
the coming years take thought for themselves.
For a moment the words pressed to his lips. Then
he realized that this was no ordinary self-committal.
To pledge himself to marry a woman of her
degree in life—an ignorant mountain girl of an
inexpressible rusticity and lack of sophistication,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
as far removed from a comprehension of the conventions
in which he had been reared and the cultivated
ideals still dear to him as if she were a
denizen of a different planet—was a serious step
indeed; he winced, and was silent.</p>

<p>This day marked a change. When they reached
home the sky was red, and a white star was alight
in the zenith. Spot stood lowing at the bars, and
Mrs. Sims’s dimples deeply indented her plumpness
as she addressed the young people in pretended
reproof.</p>

<p>“I sent you-uns arter Spot. From now on I
be a-goin’ ter sen’ Spot arter you-uns.”</p>

<p>Summoned by the sound of her chuckle out came
briskly Tubal Cain, venomous with fault-finding
and repining. “Hyar ye be, Euphemy Sims,” he
said, more harshly than he had ever before spoken
to her, “a-foolin’ away yer time huntin’ fur a cow
what war standin’ at the bars sence long ’fore sundown,
ez sensible ez grown folks, an’ Pa’son Tynes
a-settin’ an’ a-settin’ hyar waitin’ ter see ye.”</p>

<p>Euphemia answered with an affronted coolness:
“Pa’son Tynes? An’ what do I keer ter see
Pa’son Tynes fur?”</p>

<p>“Pa’son Tynes keer ter see you-uns, Phemie:
that’s what makes yer dad hop roun’ like a pea
on a hot shovel,” said Mrs. Sims.</p>

<p>Royce began to have an illuminating sense that
“Daddy Sims” was flattered to have so distinguished
a guest as Pa’son Tynes, with his widespread
oratorical fame, awaiting by the hour Euphemia’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
return, and that he could hardly forgive
his idol that these precious moments had been
wasted in the juggler’s society. Royce perceived
the farcical antithesis of the theory which he had
been arguing all the afternoon, and realized that
there are arbitrary gradations in less sophisticated
society than that on which he had predicated
the proposition. He felt very small indeed,
being thus called upon to look up to Pa’son
Tynes.</p>

<p>“I dunno what he be wantin’ ter see <i>me</i> fur,”
said Euphemia, still with the resentment of being
esteemed dilatory, and evidently apprehending a
purpose in the call other than the enjoyment of
her conversation.</p>

<p>“Me nuther,” chuckled Mrs. Sims; “you-uns
bein’ seen a outdacious ugly gal ez all the menfolks
be compelled ter shade thar eyes whenst ye
kem about.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sims’s vicarious coquetry was unblushingly
fickle. She did not wait for Euphemia to
be quit of the old love before she was on with the
new. Nay, in the very presence of the superseded
swain she prospectively and speculatively flirted
with his problematic successor.</p>

<p>“A plague on all fat old women!” thought the
juggler, ill at ease and out of countenance.</p>

<p>“I hev got my religion,” said Euphemia stiffly,
her pride revolting at the idea that perchance
Pa’son Tynes had presumed her to be still unconverted,
and that his call was pastoral. “I <i>dunno<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
what</i> he kin be a-comin’ pesterin’ round about me
fur.”</p>

<p>“Waal,” said her mother, still chuckling, “he be
a-comin’ agin ter-morrer ter see you-uns. He axed
me special ter keep ye home ter view him—no,
that wasn’t the way; he knows thar’s better things
ter be viewed in this world ’n a lantern-jawed,
tallow-faced preacher-man, though from thar own
account thar’ll be a power o’ nangels featured like
that in heaven—he axed me special ter keep ye
home till he could <i>view you-uns</i>!” And Mrs.
Sims’s chuckle of enjoyment broke from its habitual
bounds and into the jolliest of obese laughter.
It might have been termed infectious had any one
present been sufficiently in spirits to be susceptible
to its influence. The juggler was disconcerted
and strangely cast down; Euphemia, doubtful,
antagonistic, prophetically affronted; and old
Tubal Cain’s interest still hinged on the topics
of the conversation during the several hours while
he had borne the parson somewhat weary company.</p>

<p>“He hev hed great grace in the pertracted meet-in’,”
her father rattled on, still flustered by the
occurrence. “He hev converted fifteen sinners;
some hardened cases, too. An’ he hev preached
wunst a day reg’lar, an’ sometimes twict.”</p>

<p>“Let him go preach some mo’, then,” retorted
Euphemia, vaguely resentful.</p>

<p>She was silent during the serving of supper,
carrying her head high, with her cheeks flushed
and her eyes alight. Royce’s glance forbore to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
follow her. He ate little, and with a downcast,
thoughtful mien he found his pipe after supper
and took it out upon the rocky slope that led to
the river. The moon was up; long, glamourous
slants of light lay athwart the Cove; the shadows
of the pines were dense along the slope, but
through their fringed branches the light filtered
like a shower of molten silver. The river was
here touched with a crystalline glitter, and here
a lustrous darkness told of its shaded depths.
Looking across the levels of the Cove, one had a
sense of the dew in the glister and sparkle of the
humid leaves. Above all rose the encompassing
mountains, imposing, dark, and stern. The little
log cabin with the swaying hopvines and the window
flaringly alight, and the glittering reflection
so far in the swift current below, had its idyllic
suggestions in the moonlight, but he was not alive
to the interests of the picturesque in humble environment,
and had no fibre that responded to the
enthusiasm of the <i>genre</i> painter. He looked toward
the house not to mark how the silver-gray hue of
its weathered logs was heightened by the smooth
effect of the moonbeams. He did not even feign
to care that one of the clay-and-stick chimneys
leaning from the wall was so awry against the sky
as to give a positive value of individuality in composing;
what it did in regard to the proper emission
of smoke was of no consequence, since it so
served the airy designs of the possible painter.
He approved of the cant of the roof no more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
if he had been an architectural precisian. He
looked with all his eyes for what he presently saw,—a
shadowy figure stole out and sat down on the
step of the passage and gazed disconsolately, as he
fancied, up at the moon.</p>

<p>“Euphemia, come down here,” he called in a
low voice.</p>

<p>She started, stared out into the mingled shadow
and sheen with dilated eyes; then, as he advanced
she rose and went down toward him.</p>

<p>As they stood there together, the girl looked out
from the shadow of the tree above them at the
blended dew and glimmer, and he looked imperiously
down at her.</p>

<p>“See here, Phemie, why is that man coming to
see you to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” she responded vaguely.</p>

<p>“Ah, but you guess;” he caught both her
hands. “Tell me why you think he is coming.”</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes to his, which had a constraining
quality for her. “He be kemin’ ter see
me—’bout—’bout Owen Haines—him—him
ez prayed fur the power—I reckon. They be
mighty close friends.”</p>

<p>He gave a short laugh of ridicule.</p>

<p>She could not join in his mirth. Only so short
a time ago its cause had been the tragedy of the
world to her. She could hardly bring herself to
admit even to herself that now, scarcely three
weeks later, she cared as little for it as if it had
never been. But her world had changed. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
it had developed! There were new countries;
strange peoples had been discovered; a marvelous
scope of emotion had been evolved. Romance had
unfolded its wondrous page. She had seen Poetry
trim its pinions and wing its flight. She had lived
a new life; she was a changeling. Where was her
old self? Her fancied love for the young religionist,
her wounded pride for his sake, her scorching,
fiery compassion for her own—all had fled.
She remembered herself in these emotions as if she
were another being. She could hardly pity Owen
Haines. If he did not care for the fleer of ridicule,
why should she? For since—she had lived
an enchanted life.</p>

<p>“What will he want of you?” demanded Royce
gravely.</p>

<p>She faltered. She feared Tynes and his powers
of argument. She dreaded, not being convinced,
but the rigors of the contest. And if Owen Haines
should, as a sacrifice to love, agree to relinquish
his “praying fur the power,” she dreaded the
renewal of their old status of “keepin’ comp’ny.”</p>

<p>“He will want me ter take Owen Haines back.”</p>

<p>“But you wouldn’t, Phemie, you wouldn’t?”
urged Royce breathlessly.</p>

<p>“He mought gin up prayin’ fur the power. I
turned him off fur that,” she hesitated.</p>

<p>Royce’s scheme was complete. All the Cove
and the mountain regarded him as a dangler after
Euphemia Sims. He could feign a hopeless jealousy.
He could hold aloof for a time, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
old status would doubtless readjust itself with the
ease and security imparted by habit. He had
gone as far as he had ever planned. Now he
could leave the rest to chance.</p>

<p>But if the life here had afforded so arid a prospect
heretofore, how could he contemplate it without
Euphemia? His very speech no other creature
could understand. He felt that he would be as
isolated as if he were on a desert island, and he
had a fiery impatience of time,—the years that
were coming seemed such long years. He had
never been more in earnest in his life, as he looked
down into her beautiful illumined face.</p>

<p>“But you will not, Euphemia,” he said, slipping
his arm around her waist. “You don’t love
him.”</p>

<p>Beyond a start, half surprise and half coyness,
she had not moved.</p>

<p>“Tell me—you care nothing for him?”</p>

<p>“Not now,” she faltered. And she felt anew
a pang for her lack of constancy.</p>

<p>He revolted at the partial admission with all a
lover’s insistence on preëminence. “Never—never!
You <i>could</i>n’t care for such a fool. And
he doesn’t love you, or he would have given up
that folly at once—or anything you wished.”</p>

<p>Even now he hesitated. The breeze swayed the
branches above them, and all the draping pendent
wild grapevines that clung about the tree were
suddenly astir. The circle of dark shadow in
which they stood was inlaid with silver glintings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
as the moonlight struck through the foliage; the
soft radiance fell full in her eyes.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> would give up all the world for you,” he
cried impulsively, “because I love you!”</p>

<p>She drew back a trifle, and looked over her
shoulder into the glittering idealization of the
familiar scenes of her life in the glamours of the
moonlight and of love. She heard the low dryadic
song of the leaves; she heard the beating of her
own heart.</p>

<p>“Tell me that you love me, Euphemia,” he
pleaded. “Tell me that.”</p>

<p>Amidst all the joy in her face there was a flash
of triumph. She was withdrawing her hands from
his, and the realization how like she was to women
of a higher sphere, despite her limitations, came
to him with a certain surprise. No sooner did
she feel her power than she had the will to wield
it. The humble little rustic was expressed only in
her outer guise. No finished coquette could have
given him a more bewildering broadside of beautiful
eyes as she said, joyously laughing, “What
makes you ask such impossible questions?”</p>

<p>The phrase was borrowed of him, in his frequent
despair of elucidating the whole scheme of civilization
to her ignorance, in their readings. He could
not laugh when it was so dexterously turned on
himself. “Tell me,” he persisted earnestly, “tell
me, Phemie—or I’ll—I’ll”—the assertion had
little humility, but he divined its effectiveness—“I’ll
go away, and never come back again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>She was still laughing, but he marked that she
no longer drew back. “Do you have to be told
<i>everything</i>?” she quoted anew from his remonstrances
because of her catechistic insistence.
“Can’t you see through anything without having
it point-blank?” with his own impatient intonation.</p>

<p>He allowed himself to be decoyed into a hasty
smile. “And you’ll send that fellow to the right-about
to-morrow?” he urged gravely.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll be glad enough ter git rid of him!”
she cried, in the extremity of her relief.</p>

<p>He realized with a momentary qualm that the
new situation must be avowed openly to justify
the position which Euphemia would sustain in
case Owen Haines should offer to relinquish, as a
sacrifice to love, the pernicious practice of “prayin’
fur the power” in public. He recognized this
step as a certain riveting of his chains; yet had he
not been eager but a moment ago to assume them?
And even now, as he looked down into her face,
radiant with that joyous sense of supremacy in his
heart, and seeming to him the most beautiful he
had ever seen, the most tender, as it responsively
looked up to his, he wondered that his untoward
fate had so relented as to bestow upon him, in his
forlorn exile, this creature, so delicately endowed,
so choicely gifted, that even his alien estimate of
values wrought no discord in the simple happiness
that had come to him.</p>

<p>And it was he who revealed to Jane Ann Sims
the altered state of things when the two went presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
back to the little cabin on the slope. There
she sat in bulky oblivion of the things of this
world, and especially the dish-pan. Her spectacles
were awry on her nodding head. The dish-towel
was limp in her nerveless hand. The tallow
dip was guttering in the centre of the table, and
about it the moths circled in fond delusions, regardless
of the winged cinders that lay, now still,
and now with a quiver of departing life, on the
cloth. She made a spasmodic offer to resign the
dish-towel to Euphemia, waving it mechanically
at her with a fat, dimpled hand and a gesture of
renunciation; but the girl, all unallured, passed
without a word into the shed-room beyond, and
the juggler sat down on the opposite side of the
table with one elbow on it as he looked steadily
across at Mrs. Sims’s face, which was all lined
with the creases of fat that were usually dimples.
She had roused into that half-dazed condition characteristic
of the sudden and unwelcome termination
of the sleep of fatigue, and the tallow dip swayed
reduplicated before her eyes like a chandelier.
Mentally she seemed no clearer of perception.
Royce had realized her maternal fondness for him,
ungratefully requited, and he could not altogether
reconcile this with the agitated and alarmed mien
with which she received his disclosure.</p>

<p>“Marry Phemie!” she exclaimed in a sort of
drowsy affright, as if her mental capacities had not
yet laid hold on something that had roused her
more alert apprehensions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>He was irritated for a moment. He knew in
his secret soul that he forswore much, overlooked
much, bestowed much, in this mad resolution, and
this knowledge, quiescent under the immediate
influence of the girl’s beauty and charm and his
loneliness, became tumultuously assertive in the
society of Mrs. Sims.</p>

<p>“Why not? I love her, and I want to marry
her. Is there anything so astonishing in that?”</p>

<p>“Laws-a-massy, no, honey!” Mrs. Sims sputtered,
her eyelids faltering before the myriad-flamed
tallow dip. She apprehended his rising
wrath, and, somnambulistically waving her hand,
seemed to seek to appease it. “Mighty nigh every
young fool ez ever seen her sets up the same
chune. ’Tain’t astonishin’—but—honey”—she
looked at him with sleepy admonition, still
waving her hand—“don’t talk ’bout sech so
brazen an’ loud.” Then sinking her voice to a
husky whisper that could have been heard in South
America, “Shet that thar door ahint ye. Tubal
Cain be asleep in thar.” Her gesture, indicating
the door, was accompanied by a premonitory jerk
of her body which usually preceded rising.</p>

<p>“Don’t disturb yourself, I beg,” said Royce,
still nettled.</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair, and catching the
door by the latch brought it to with a brisk bang.
Mrs. Sims pursed up her mouth with a warning
hiss imposing silence to preserve the gentle slumbers
of old Tubal Cain, and neither noticed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
the latch had failed to catch, and that the door,
although apparently closed, stood slightly ajar.</p>

<p>“Phemie says—at least she gives me to understand
that my affection is returned,” Royce went
on, in better humor.</p>

<p>“I hope she ain’t tellin’ no lies ’bout’n it this
time, ennyhow,” said Mrs. Sims waggishly; and
it seemed to Royce that he was capable of singular
temerity when he had risked the perils of seriously
falling in love by simulating the tender passion in
any instance in which Mrs. Sims was to be considered,
however remotely. To be good-natured
in ridicule by no means implies good nature in
being ridiculed.</p>

<p>“You have a right to say anything you like, I
suppose, about your own daughter,” he rejoined
angrily. “She doesn’t look like a liar. For my
part, I believe her.”</p>

<p>“Shucks! Shucks!” Mrs. Sims shook a mildly
admonitory head at him. “I’m jes’ funnin’. An’
yit I kin ’member tellin’ Tubal Cain things cornsider’ble
short o’ the truth whenst I war a young
gal like Euphemy, an’ he war a-sparkin’ round.”</p>

<p>The young man looked uneasily out of the window.
Could time really work such metamorphoses
as these? Had she ever been young and lissome
and soft-eyed and fair, and was Euphemia to grow
old thus?</p>

<p>Perhaps it was well for the broken snatch of
Love’s young dream that there against the darkness
he suddenly saw the bending boughs of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
elder bush all whitely abloom, and among them,
the fairest blossom of all, Euphemia’s face, half
touched with the moonlight, yet distinct in the
radiance that came from the candle within, smiling
upon him as she played the eavesdropper, her dimpled
elbows on the window-sill and her fair hair
blown back in the wind.</p>

<p>“Nothing was said about it till this evening,”
he went on, his satisfaction restored in an instant,
“and I thought it was only the fair thing to let
you and Mr. Sims know; you have both been so
kind since I have been here.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sims’s preliminary apprehension, which
she seemed to have forgotten, was once more
aghast upon her face. She raised a warning forefinger,
and she spoke in her husky penetrating
whisper: “Don’t you-uns say nare word ter Tubal
Cain Sims. Leave him ter <i>me</i>. I’ll settle him.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked the young man, alert to any
menace, however remote.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sims knitted her brows in embarrassment.
“Waal,” she said, composing herself to divulge
the truth so far as she knew it, since no polite
subterfuge was handy, “he air cantankerous, an’
quar’lsome, an’ hard-headed, an’ powerful perverse.
An’ he ’pears ter be sot agin ye, kase, I
reckon, I like ye,—me an’ Phemie, though Phemie
never tuk no notice o’ ye in this worl’ till
’bout three weeks ago whenst ye ondertook ter set
up ter her so constant. Ye hev witched that gal;
ye jes’ <i>made</i> her fall in love with ye, whether or no.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>The juggler laughed at this, casting a bright
glance at the dusky aperture of the window where
the white blossoms all stirred by the wind seemed
to be leaning on the sill and eavesdropping too.
They might not have all been so happily at ease
had they known that, close by the door, still
slightly ajar, and awakened by the bang which the
juggler had dealt it, lay old Tubal Cain Sims,
grimly listening to this conversation.</p>

<p>“I can’t agree to that,” said Royce, after a
moment’s reflection. He was certainly nothing
of a prig, but he had his own views of honor, and
they controlled him. “This is Mr. Sims’s house;
and I was received into it first as a guest, and it
is as a privilege that I have been allowed to remain.
I can’t make love to any man’s daughter,
under these circumstances, on the sly.”</p>

<p>“But s’pose he won’t agree—an’ the critter is
ez <i>con</i>trary ez—ez”—Comparisons failed Mrs.
Sims, and she could only shake her head warningly.</p>

<p>“Oh well, everything having been aboveboard,
I’d take the girl and elope!” cried the juggler,
his eyes alight at the mere prospective fanning of
the breeze of adventure. “Being an educated
man, Mrs. Sims, I could make a living for myself
and my wife in a dozen different ways, in any of
these little towns about here. Why—what”—</p>

<p>Mrs. Sims, bulkily rising, had almost overturned
the table and the crockery upon him. Her fat
face was pallid and flabby, and it shook as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
gazed, speechless and wild-eyed, at him. Her
puffy hand besought him in mute entreaty before
she could find words to blurt out, “Good Gawd
A’mighty, John Leonard, don’t lay yer tongue
ter sech ez that! Don’t s’picion the word ez ye’d
steal my darter away from me. It would kill me—an’
I hev stood yer frien’ from the fust, even
whenst they all made out ez ye war in league with
Satan an’ gin over ter witchments. It would kill
me, bodaciously! Don’t ye steal my one leetle
lamb—thar’s plenty o’ gals in the worl’, ready
an’ willin’—steal them—steal them! I want
my darter ter live hyar with me, married an’ single,—ter
live hyar with me. We ain’t got but
the one lone, lorn leetle chile. Don’t—don’t”—The
tears stood in all her dimples and she was
speechless.</p>

<p>“Well, upon my word!” exclaimed Royce indignantly,
but pausing, with that care which he
bestowed upon all manner of possessions representing
property, however meagre, to right the table
and restore the imperiled crockery. “What sort
of a frenzy is this, Mrs. Sims? Am I going to
run away with your daughter? Have I shown
any symptoms of decamping? Strikes me I have
come to stay. I make a point of telling you—because
I know that I am not here under your roof
for any small profit to you, but as a matter of
kindness and courtesy—of telling you all about it
within the hour that I know it myself, and this is
my reward!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>Poor Mrs. Sims, having sunk back in her chair,
and the young man still remaining standing, could
only look up at him with piteous contrition and
anxious appeal.</p>

<p>“I hope Mr. Sims won’t give me any reason to
contemplate elopement. Wasn’t he willing for
his daughter to marry Owen Haines, they having
been ‘keepin’ comp’ny,’ as I understand?”</p>

<p>She silently nodded.</p>

<p>“My Lord! what have I come to!” Royce
cried, lifting his hands, then letting them fall to
his sides, as if calling on heaven and earth to witness
the absurdity of the situation. “I think I
might be considered at least as desirable a <i>parti</i>
as that pious monkey praying for the power!” He
gave that short laugh of his which so expressed
ridicule, turned, secured the end of tallow candle
placed for him on the shelf, and, lighting it, ascended
the rickety stairs to the roof-room.</p>

<p>The suggestion of an elopement was not altogether
unacceptable to him. If there should be
any objection urged against him,—and he could
hardly restrain his mirth at the idea,—an elopement
into some other retired cove in these regions
of nowhere would result not infelicitously, affording
still further disguise and an adequate reason
for both him and his wife to be strangers in a
strange land. “A runaway match would account
for everything: so bring on your veto and welcome!”
he said to himself.</p>

<p>Next morning, however, he found his disclosure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
to Tubal Cain Sims postponed. His host had left
the house before dawn, and although he did not
return for any of the three meals Mrs. Sims felt
no uneasiness, it being a practice of Tubal Cain
Sims’s, in order to assert his independence of petticoat
government, to deal much in small mysteries
about his affairs. All day—her equanimity restored
by the half-jocular, half-affectionate raillery
of Royce, who had roused himself to the realization
that it was well to continue friends with her—she
canvassed her husband’s errand, and guessed
at the time of his probable return, and speculated
upon his reasons for secrecy. Night did not bring
him, and Royce, who had been now laughing at
Mrs. Sims’s various theories, and now wearying
of their futile inconsistencies, began to share her
curiosity.</p>

<p>It was the merest curiosity. He did not dream
that he was the chief factor in his host’s schemes
and absence.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IX.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tubal Cain Sims</span> still continued to harbor the
theory that the juggler’s unexplained and lingering
stay in Etowah Cove betokened that he sought
immunity here from the consequences of crime,
and that he was a fugitive from justice. In no
other way could he interpret those strange words,
“—But the one who lives—for his life!—his
life!—his life!” cried out from troubled dreams
in the silence of the dark midnight. Although
this view had been shared by the lime-burners
when first he had sought to enlist their prejudice,
for he would fain rid his house of this ill-flavored
association, of late their antagonism had
flagged. Only Peter Knowles seemed to abide
by their earlier impression, but Peter Knowles
was now absorbed heart and soul in burning
lime, as the time for its use was drawing near.
Sims began to understand the luke-warmness of
the others when he noted the interest of the young
man in his beautiful daughter: they deemed him
now merely a lover. This discovery had come but
lately to Sims, for he was of a slow and plodding
intelligence, and hard upon it followed the revelations
he had overheard through the open door the
previous evening. It was evidently an occasion for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
haste. While he loitered, this stranger, encouraged
by the vicarious coquetry of Jane Ann Sims,
might marry Euphemia; and when the juggler
should be haled to the bar of justice for his crimes,
the Cove would probably perceive in the dispensation
only a judgment upon her parents for having
made an idol of their own flesh and blood.</p>

<p>He realized, as many another man has done,
that in extreme crises, involving risk, quondam
friendships are but as broken reeds, and he was
leaning stoutly only upon his own fealty to his
own best interests, as he jogged along on his old
brown mare, with her frisky colt at her heels,
down the red clay roads of the cove, and through
rugged mountain passes into still other coves, on
his way to Colbury, the county town. His heart
burned hot within him against Jane Ann Sims
when he recalled her advice to the man to say
nothing to him, the head of the house and the
father of the girl! She’d settle <i>him</i>! Would
she, indeed? And he relished with a grim zest,
as a sort of reparation, the fright she had suffered
at the bare possibility of an elopement. Then this
recollection, reacting on his own heart, set it all
a-plunging, as he toiled on wearily in the hot sun,
lest this disaster might chance during his absence,
and he found himself leaning appealingly, forlornly,
on the honor of the very man whom his
mission was to ruin if he could. It was he who
had refused to dispense with the father’s consent
could it be obtained, and the perfidious Jane Ann<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
Sims had counseled otherwise; he who had taken
note of hospitality and courtesy,—much of which,
in truth, had been mere seeming. More than once
it almost gave Sims pause to reflect to whom he
was indebted for any show of consideration. He
had, however, but one daughter. This plea, he
felt, might serve to excuse unfounded suspicion,
and make righteous a breach of hospitality, and
even justify cruelty. “One darter!” he often
said to himself as he went along, all unaware that
if he had had six his cares, his solicitude, his
paternal affection, would have been meted out six-fold,
so elastic is the heart to the strain upon its
resources.</p>

<p>For this cause, despite his softened judgment
toward the juggler, he did not flinch when he
reached Colbury, and made his way across the
“Square,” where every eye seemed to his anxious
consciousness fixed upon him, as if attributing to
him some nefarious designs on the liberty of an
innocent man. But in reality the town folks of
Colbury were far too sophisticated in their own
esteem to accord the slightest note to an old codger
from the mountains,—a region as remote to the
majority, save now and then for a glimpse of an
awe-stricken visitor from the backwoods, as the
mythical island of Atlantis. For such explorations
into the world at large as the ambitious citizens of
Colbury adventured led them not into the scorned
rural wilds comprehensively known to them as
“’way up in the Cove.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>Tubal Cain Sims had been here but twice before:
once when there was a political rally early
after the war, and later as a witness for the defense
in a case of murder. The crowded, confused,
jostling political experience still thronged
unintelligibly the retina of his mind’s eye, but
order and quiet distinguished the glimpse vouchsafed
him of the workings of justice. He had
evolved a great respect for judicial methods, and
he felt something like a glow of pride to see the
court-house still standing so spacious and stately,
as it seemed to him, within its inclosures, the surrounding
grass green and new, and the oak boughs
clustering above the columns of the porch. He
was not aware how long he stood and gazed at it,
his eyes alight, his cheek flushed. If the question
had been raised, he would have known, of course,
that the Juggernaut car of justice had held steadily
on its inexorable way through all the years that
had since intervened, and that his individual lack
of a use for it had not banished it from the earth;
but Tubal Cain was not a man of speculation,
and it smote him with a sort of gratified surprise
to see the court-house on its stanch stone foundations
as it was in the days when he and it conserved
so intimate a relation. There were two
or three lawyers on the steps or passing in at the
gate, but he eyed these members of the tribe
askance. The value which he placed on counsel
was such confidence as he might repose in a shooting-iron
with a muzzle at both ends,—as liable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
go off in one direction as in the other; and thus it
was that, with a hitch of the reins, he reminded
himself anew of his errand, and took his way down
the declivity of a straggling little street, where
presently the houses grew few and small, dwindling
first to shabby tumble-down old cottages,
then to sundry dilapidated blacksmith shops, beyond
which stretched a rocky untenanted space, as
if all habitation shrunk from neighboring the little
jail which stood alone between the outer confines
of the town and the creek.</p>

<p>Here also he came to a halt, looking at the surly
building with recognizing eyes. And to it too
these years had not been vacant. All the time
of his absence, in the far-away liberties of the
mountains, with the unshackled wind and the free
clouds and the spontaneous growths of the earth
out of its own untrammeled impulse, this grim
place had been making its record of constraints,
and captives, and limits, and locks, and longing
bursting hearts, and baffled denied eyes, and
yearning covetings of freedom, the bitterness of
which perhaps no free creature can know. Surely,
surely, these darkening elements of the moral
atmosphere had turned the bricks to their dingy
hue. The barred windows gave on vague black
interiors. A cloud was in the air above, with now
and then a mutter of thunder, and the sullen jail
lay in a shadow, and the water ran black in the
green-fringed creek at the foot of the hill, while
behind him at its summit, where the street intersected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
the open square, the sunlight fell in such
golden suffusions that a clay-bank horse with his
rider motionless against the blue sky beyond might
have seemed an equestrian statue in bronze, commemorating
the valiance of some bold cavalry
leader. Tubal Cain wondered to see the jail so
still and solitary; and where could be the man
whom he had pictured sitting in all the luxury of
possession on the front doorsteps, smoking his
pipe?</p>

<p>This man of his imagination was the sheriff of
the county, who did not avail himself of his privilege
to appoint a jailer, but turned the keys himself
and dwelt in his stronghold. He was of an
over-exacting cast of mind. He could never believe
a prisoner secure unless with his own hands
he had drawn the bolts. On account of the great
vogue attained by various crimes at this period,
and the consequent overcrowding of the prisons
throughout the State, a considerable number of
captured moonshiners had been billeted on the
Kildeer County jail while awaiting trial in the
Federal Court, and by reason of this addition to
his charge his vigilance was redoubled. In all the
details of his office he carried the traits of a
precisian, and was in some sort a thorn in the
side of the more easy-going county officers with
whom his official duties brought him into contact.
Even the judge in his high estate on the bench
was now and again nettled by the difficult questions
of punctilio with which this servant of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
court could contrive to invest some trifling matter,
and was known to incline favorably to the salutary
theory of rotation in office,—barring, of course,
the judicial office. But the sheriff had three minie
balls in him which he had collected on various
battlefields in the South; and although he had
fought on a side not altogether popular in this
region, they counted for him at the polls in successive
elections, without the formalities of statutory
qualifications and with a wondrous power of reduplication
in the number of resulting votes. He
was reputed of an extraordinary valor on those
hard-contested fields where he had found his bullets,
but there were advanced occasionally caviling
criticisms of his record on the score that, being
incapable of originating a course of action, it
never occurred to him to run away when his command
was ordered to advance, and that his bravery
was simply the fixed stolidity of adhering to another
man’s idea in default of any ideas of his
own. In proof of this it was cited that when
he was among a guard detailed to hold a gin-house
full of cotton, and the enemy surprised the
sentinel and captured the building, he alone stood
like a stock with his rifle still at a serene “shoulder-arms,”
where it was ordered to be, while his
comrades undertook a deploying evolution of their
own invention at a mad double-quick, without a
word of command, showing the cleanest of nimble
heels across the country. But he was esteemed by
these depreciators a lucky fool, for since the war,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
having an affinity for the office of sheriff, he had
more than once been obliged to decline to make
the race, and lie off a term or two, because of the
law which will not permit the office to be held by
the same person eight years without an interval.
His fad for being in the direct line of the enemy’s
fire had not resulted more disastrously than to
give him some painful hospital experience; the
balls had come to stay, and apparently the hard
metal of his constitution served to assimilate them
easily enough, for he was hale and hearty, and
bade fair to live to a green old age, and they never
made themselves heard of save at election times,
when in effect they stuffed the ballot-box.</p>

<p>Having voted for him so often, and with that
immense estimate of the value of a single ballot
common to the backwoodsman little conversant
with the power of numbers, Tubal Cain Sims felt
a possessory claim on the sheriff as having made
him such. He stood in dismay and doubt for a
moment, gazing at the stout closed door that
opened, when it opened at all, directly on the descending
flight of steps, without any ceremonial
porch or other introduction to entrance; then,
after the manner of Etowah Cove, he lifted up his
voice in a stentorian halloo and hailed the grim
and silent house.</p>

<p>The sound seemed a spell to waken it into life.
The echo of his shouts came back from the brick
walls so promptly as to simulate two imperative
voices rather than acoustic mimicry. Sudden pale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
faces showed at the bars, wearing the inquiring
startled mien of alarm and surprise. The rattle
of a chain heralded the approach of a great guard-dog
dragging a block from around the corner.
With his big bull-like head lowered and his fangs
showing between his elastic lips, he stood fiercely
surveying the stranger for a short time; then—and
Tubal Cain Sims could have more readily forgiven
a frantic assault, for he had his pistol in his
hand—the sagacious brute sat down abruptly, and
continued to contemplate the visitor, but with a
certain air of non-committal curiosity, evidently
realizing that his vocation was not to deter people
from getting into jail, but to prevent them from
getting out. The pallid faces at the windows were
laughing, despite the bars; and although nettled
by the ridicule they expressed, Tubal Sims made
bold to lift up his voice again: “Hello, Enott!
Enott Blake! Lemme in! Lemme in, I say!
Hello, Enott!”</p>

<p>The faces of the spectators were distended anew.
At those windows where there was more than one,
they were turned toward each other for the luxury
of an exchange of winks and leers. When a face
was alone it grinned jocular satisfaction to itself,
and one man, with a large red and facetious
countenance, now and again showed a lifted hand
smiting an unseen leg, in the extremity of solitary
joy. The dog, with his big head still lowered and
his drooping lips a-quiver, gave a surly growl of
displeasure, when the colt, having somewhat recovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
from the fatigues of its long journey, began
to frisk nimbly, and to curvet and caracole; the
mare turned her head anxiously about as she
watched these gyrations. Tubal Cain glared at
the men at the windows. They had little to laugh
at, doubtless, but why should they so gratuitously
laugh at him? A tide of abashed mortification
carried the blood to his head. His stanch self-respect
had heretofore precluded the suspicion that
he was ever the object of ridicule, and now his
pride revolted at his plight; but since he could
not get at his mockers and inflict condign punishment,
naught remained but to manfully persist in
his course as if they were not. He dismounted,
threw the reins over a hitching-post, advanced
through the gate of the narrow yard, his pistol in
his hand for fear of the formidable dog, and ascended
the steps with a resolute tread. He dealt
a resounding double-knock with the butt end of
his shooting-iron, crying as he did so upon Enott
Blake as a “dad-burned buzzard” to unlock the
door or he would break it down. Suddenly it
opened, and by the force of his expectant blow he
fell forward into the hall; then it closed behind
him with a bang that shook the house.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” exclaimed an irate
voice. “Jeemes, take his weepon.”</p>

<p>And albeit Tubal Sims stoutly held on to it, a
scientific crack on the knuckles administered by
a dapper light-haired young man caused the stiff
old fingers to relax and yield the pistol to the custody
of the law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>Tubal Sims confronted a tall, spare, vigorous
man about fifty-five years of age, with iron-gray
hair worn with a certain straight lank effect and
parted far on the side, a florid complexion, and a
bright yellowish-gray eye which delivered the kind
of glance popularly held to resemble an eagle’s.
His look was very intent as he gazed in the twilight
of the grimy hall at Tubal Cain Sims, who began
to feel a quiver at the lack of recognition it expressed.
To be sure, Tubal Sims knew that he
had no acquaintance with the man, but somehow
he had not counted on this total unresponsiveness
to his claim upon the officer.</p>

<p>“I hev voted fur you-uns fur sher’ff nine time
out’n ten,” he said, with the rancor of reproach
for benefits conferred unworthily.</p>

<p>He stood with a very large majority of the enlightened
citizens of the county. Enott Blake
had been but recently reëlected, but if his canvass
were to be made anew it is barely possible that he
would have fancied he might have weathered it
without the support of this ancient adherent. His
office was of the sort which is not compatible with
any show of personal favor, and he resented the
reminder of political services as an imputation.</p>

<p>“Well, ye have got a sheriff that knows what
attempted house-breaking is,” he said severely.
“And unless ye can show a good reason for tryin’
to break into that door, ye’ll find ye have got a
sheriff that will take a power o’ pains ye don’t
break out again soon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>Tubal Cain’s face, all wind-blown and red with
the sun, and rugged with hard grooved wrinkles,
and nervous with the untoward complications of
achieving an audience with the man he had ridden
so far to see, was shattered from the congruity of
his gravity into a sort of fragmentary laughter out
of keeping with the light of anxiety in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Did ye ever hear of a man tryin’ ter break
inter a jail?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I caught you doin’ it to the best of your ability,”
returned the literal-minded sheriff.</p>

<p>Tubal Cain would have felt as if he were dreaming
had it not been for sundry recollections of
stories of the matter-of-fact tendencies of the officer
which were far from reassuring. He felt that
he could hardly have faced the situation had not
the dapper round-visaged young deputy, whose
blond hair curled like a baby’s in tendrils on his
red, freckled forehead, glanced up at him with a
jocose wink as he proceeded to draw the cartridges
from the mountaineer’s shooting-iron; the triumph
of capture was still in his eye, while he lounged
carelessly over the banisters of the staircase to evade
the responsibility and labor of standing upright.</p>

<p>“Own up, daddy,” he cavalierly admonished
the elder. “Tell what you were aimin’ to do.
To rescue prisoners”—his superior snorted at the
very word—“or rob us of our vally’bles?” The
sheriff turned upon the deputy with a stare of inquiry
as if wondering what these might be; then,
vaguely apprehending the banter, said severely:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>“Cuttin’ jokes about your bizness, Jeemes, so
constant, makes me ’feard it’s a leetle bit too
confinin’ for such a gay bird as you. Bar-keepin’
in a saloon would fit your build better’n the sort
o’ bar-keepin’ we do here, I’m thinkin’.”</p>

<p>Enott Blake might be laughed at on occasion,
but he had a trick of making other men as serious
as himself when he sought to play upon their
foibles. The blond deputy’s countenance showed
that it had another and deeper tinge of red in its
capacity; he came to the perpendicular suddenly
as, without lifting his eyes, he continued to revolve
the cylinder of the pistol and to draw the cartridges
seriatim. He was but newly appointed,
and zealous of the favor of his superior.</p>

<p>“I dunno how I could bear up, though,” he
said, with apology in the cadence of his voice, “if
I didn’t crack a joke wunst in a while, considering
I’m just broke into harness.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact,” admitted the martial elder,
visibly and solemnly placated. “Do you know
what we were doin’ while you yelled, an’ capered,
an’ cut up them monkey-shines in front of the
jail?” he demanded sternly, turning to Tubal
Cain Sims. “We were cuttin’ a man down that
tried to hang himself.”</p>

<p>“Suicidin’,” put in the deputy, as if making a
nice distinction between this voluntary suspension
and the legal execution.</p>

<p>“An’ we were bringin’ the man to himself
agin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>“He’s crazy, crazy as a loon,” interpolated the
deputy in a mutter, pulling the trigger and snapping
the hammer of the empty weapon, and sighting
it unpleasantly down the hall, aiming alternately
at the sheriff and at Tubal Cain Sims, who
could scarcely repress an admonition, but for awe’s
sake desisted.</p>

<p>“Or more likely, simulatin’ insanity,” said the
sheriff; “it’s plumb epidemic nowadays ’mongst
the crim’nals.”</p>

<p>“Well, he come mighty nigh lightin’ out for
a country where no vain pretenses avail,” remarked
the loquacious deputy, one eye closed, and drawing
a very fine line from the bridge of old Sims’s nose
with the empty pistol.</p>

<p>“This is a country where they don’t avail,
either,” retorted the sheriff, “not with any reasonable
jury. And twelve men, though liable to be
fools, ain’t fools o’ the same pattern. That’s the
main thing: impanel a variety o’ fools, an’ the verdic’
is generally horse sense. Now, sir,” turning
on Tubal Cain Sims, who could feel his hat rising
up on his hair, “what do you want, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Ter git out,—that’s all; ter git out o’ hyar!”
exclaimed Tubal Sims, sickened with a ghastly
horror of the presentment of the scene they had
left, the walls that harbored it, the roof that sheltered
it. Oh for the free pure mountain air, the
wild untrodden lengths of the mountain wilderness,
fresh with the sun and the dew, and the vigor of
natural growths, and the sweet scent of woodland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
ways! As he cast up his eyes to the high window
above the staircase he could have cried out aloud
to see the bars, and he gazed at the door in a desperation
that started the drops on his brow and
brought the blood to his face, as if the intensity of
his emotion had been some strong physical effort.</p>

<p>“What did you get in here for, then?” demanded
the sheriff. “Most folks have to be
fetched.”</p>

<p>Tubal Cain Sim’s heart failed him. Could it
be possible that he had ever designed a fate like
this for the man who had slept under his roof;
who had eaten his bread; who had refused to
maintain secrecy against him; who considered him
and his claims, when his own, his very own, passed
them by? He could not realize it. He refused
to credit his cherished scheme; he felt that if once
away from the paralyzing sight of the place, invention
would rouse itself anew. Some other device
would serve to rid the Cove of the man, and to
frustrate his elopement with Euphemia. Tubal
Sims was sure he could compass a new plan if once
more he were free in the clear and open air.</p>

<p>The eagle eye of the sheriff marked the alert
turning of Sims’s head toward the door. “What
did you come here for, then?” he again demanded.</p>

<p>With hot eyes glancing hither and thither like
a wild thing’s in a trap, Tubal Sims replied, with
the inspiration of the moment, “I wanted ter view
the man I hev voted fur so often an’ so constant.”</p>

<p>Now, the sheriff, like many other great men in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
their several places, had his vanity, and it is not
hard to convince one who has been before the
public eye that he fills that orb to the exclusion of
any less worthy object. That Tubal Cain Sims
should have journeyed fully thirty-five miles from
the mountains to contemplate the resplendent dignity
of the sheriff in his oft-resumed incumbency
seemed possibly no disproportionate tribute to
Enott Blake’s estimate of his own merits. But
this view, however flattering, was hardly compatible
with the lordly manner in which the old mountaineer
had beaten upon the door of the jail, and
the imperative tones with which he had summoned
forth the servant of the public who owed his high
estate to the suffrages of him aided by the likes
of him.</p>

<p>A wonderful change is wrought in the moral
atmosphere of a man by the event of an election.
The candidate’s estate is vested by the announcement
of the result. He owns his office for the
time, and he breathes a free man. It is interesting
to see how the muscles of his metaphorical
knees straighten out, for the day of genuflection
is over. Independence is reasserted in his eye; he
bears himself as one who conquers by the prowess
of his own bow and spear; and men whom he
would fain conciliate last week need to search his
eye for an expression they can recognize. They
will be treated no more to that mollifying demonstration,
the candidate’s smile.</p>

<p>The defeated aspirant’s once bland countenance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
however, has assumed all the contours of the
cynic’s. A bitter sort of nonchalance with a
frequent forced laugh goes better combined with
peanuts, if the place is not too high in the official
scale and the candidate of no great social pretensions,
since the hulls can be cast off with a flouting
gesture which aids the general implication that the
constituency may appropriately go hang, for all
he cares. He is not hurt,—not he! He made
the race to oblige his friends and party, and he
now and again throws out intimations of a bigger
piece of pie saving for him as a reward for filling
the breach. Meantime peanuts perforce suffice.</p>

<p>Enott Blake, through much place-holding, had
become imbued with the candidate’s antagonism
to that assumption of all the power residing in the
voting masses common to the arrogant but impotent
unit. He was never elected by any one man,
nor through any definitely exerted political influence.
He served the people, and incidentally his
own interest, and mighty glad they ought to be to
get him, and this was what he felt especially after
elections. If ever in the course of a canvass he
had a qualm,—and it is said that the least imaginative
of men are capable of nightmare,—he had
the satisfaction of calling himself a fool thereafter,
to think less of himself than people thought of
him, and of counting endearingly his minie balls.
He was a rare instance of a great personal popularity,
and he had no mind to abate his pretensions
before the preposterous patronage of this old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
mountaineer who possibly had not paid poll-tax
for twenty years. He could no more be said to
possess an enlightened curiosity than the hound
trained to trail game could be accredited with an
inquisitive interest in the natural history of the
subject of his quest. It was only with a similar
rudimentary instinct of the pursuit of prey that
he felt stirring an intention to wring from the intruder
the real reason for this strange entrance.</p>

<p>“No, no, my friend,” he said, with a kindling
of his keen eye which expressed a degree of ferocity,
“you can’t come it that-a-way on me. I’m
a mighty fine man, I know, but folks ain’t got to
sech a pass yet as to break into jail for a glimpse
of me. You don’t get out of that door”—he
nodded his head at it—“till you give me a reasonable
reason for your extraordinary conduc’.”</p>

<p>Tubal Cain Sims was silent. His hard old lips
suddenly shut fast. His eyes gleamed with a
dogged light. He would not speak had he no will
to speak, and the officer should see which could
hold out the longest at this game. He remembered
how often he had hearkened to the complaints
of the preternatural quality of his obstinacy
with which Jane Ann Sims had beguiled the conjugal
way since, a quarter of a century ago, they
had left the doorstep of Parson Greenought’s
house man and wife. Surely, if it had time and
again vanquished Jane Ann Sims, how could the
sheriff, a mere man, abide it? He had not, however,
reckoned on certain means of compulsion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
which were not within the power of the doughty
contestant for domestic supremacy.</p>

<p>There was no visible communication between
the older officer and the deputy when the young
man said appealingly, “Ye won’t need handcuffs,
Mr. Blake? Leastwise not till after we come
from the jestice’s?”</p>

<p>“Handcuffs!” screeched Tubal Sims, as violently
cast out from the stronghold of his obstinate
silence as if he had been hurtled thence by a catapult.
“Ye hev got no right to handcuff me! I
kem hyar of my own free will an’ accord. I ain’t
no prisoner. Open that thar door,” he continued,
lowering his voice to a tone of command and turning
majestically to the sheriff. “Open that door,
or I’ll hev the law of ye.”</p>

<p>“Not till I have had the law of you,” replied
the imperturbable functionary. “But, Jeemes,”—he
turned with a disaffected aside to his young
colleague,—“what d’ye go namin’ irons for?
’Tain’t polite to talk ’bout ironin’ a man old
enough to be your father.”</p>

<p>The deputy looked about in vague despair. He
had but sought the effect upon the imagination of
the mention of shackles, and indeed his words had
potently affected the fancy of the only man in the
room who possessed that illusive pictorial faculty.
The stanch old mountaineer was all a-tremble.
What would Jane Ann Sims think of this? He
might have known that this journeying abroad in
secret and without her advice would result disastrously!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
What indeed would Jane Ann Sims
think of this?</p>

<p>“Open that door!” he vociferated. “Ye hev
got no right ter detain <span class="smcap">Me</span>!”</p>

<p>“What for not?” demanded the sheriff sternly.
“What d’ye call this fix’n’?” He opposed to
Tubal Cain Sims’s nose, with the trifling intervenient
space of an inch, his own pistol.</p>

<p>“Shootin’-iron!” sputtered Tubal, squinting
fearfully at it.</p>

<p>“Worn in defiance o’ the law and to the terror
o’ the people,” said the sheriff frowningly. “I
have got to be indicted myself or to arrest you on
that charge. And I reckon you know you ain’t
got no right to carry concealed weepons.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t got no right ter w’ar a shootin’-iron!”
exclaimed Tubal Sims, his eyes starting out of his
head.</p>

<p>“Agin the law,” said the deputy airily.</p>

<p>“Agin the law!” echoed Tubal Sims, his back
against the wall, and his eyes turning first to one,
then to the other of his companions. “Lord!
Lord! I never knowed afore how fur the flat-woods
war abint the mountings! How air ye goin’ ter
pertec’ yerself agin yer neighbor ’thout no shootin’-iron?”
he asked cogently.</p>

<p>“By the law,” said both officers in unison.</p>

<p>“Thar ain’t no law in the mountings, thank
Gawd!” cried Tubal Sims.</p>

<p>“There is law here,” declared the sheriff, “and
a plenty of it to go round.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>“Thank Gawd!” echoed the pious deputy.</p>

<p>“Come, old man!” said the sheriff. “Come in
here an’ set down, an’ sorter straighten out, an’
tell me what in hell ailed ye to come bangin’ on
the jail door with a weepon called a shootin’-iron
till you git yourself arrested for crim’nal offense.
Surely, surely, you have got <i>some</i> reason in you.”</p>

<p>He flung open a door close at hand, and Tubal
Cain Sims, his knees trembling under him, so
great was the nervous reaction in his metamorphosis
from the masterful accuser to the despairing
accused, was ushered into a room which seemed to
him dark despite the glare of sunlight that fell
broadside half across the bare floor from two tall
windows,—a gaunt and haggard apartment suggestive
of the intention of the building of which it
was a part. These windows were not grated, but
the fleckings of moving clouds barred the sunlight
on the floor, and the mutter of thunder came renewed
to the ear. The dust lay thick on the table
in the centre of the room. A lounge covered with
a startlingly gay quilt was in one corner, where
Tubal Cain presumed the sheriff, in moments of
fatigue which might be supposed to overpower
even his stiff military figure in the deep midnight,
slept with one eye open. A desk in the jamb by
the fireplace held several bulky books, a large
inkstand, a bag of fine-cut tobacco, a coarse glass
tumbler which had nothing in it but a rank smell
of a strong grade of corn whiskey, and a pipe half
full of dead ashes, which the sheriff had hastily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
laid aside when summoned to the scene of the horrors
perpetrated by a forlorn human being in the
desperation of the fear of still greater horrors to
come.</p>

<p>Tubal Cain Sims’s mind, unaccustomed to morbid
influences, could not detach itself from the
idea. Despite his absorptions on his own account,
he followed as an independent train of thought
futile speculations as to where in the building this
man might be,—close at hand, and he felt a nervous
thrill at the possible propinquity, or in some
remote cell and out of hearing; what had he guiltily
done, or was he falsely accused; had he been
really resuscitated, or had the potentialities of life
merely flickered up like the spurious quickening
of a failing candle before the moment of extinction,
and was he even now, while the officers lingered
here, dead again, and this time beyond
recall; or would he not, left to his own devices,
once more attempt his life? The old mountaineer
could not forbear. He turned to the sheriff with
an excited eye.</p>

<p>“Ain’t ye ’feard he’ll hang hisself again?” he
said huskily.</p>

<p>The officer stared. “Who?” he inquired, with
knitted brow, as if he had forgotten the occurrence
absolutely; then with renewing recollection, “You
can bet your life he won’t.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Sims, the clatter of his
boots on the bare floor silent as he stopped short.</p>

<p>The deputy gave a fleering laugh, ending in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
“ki-yi” of the extremity of derision. He had
flung himself into a chair, and, with his elbows on
the table, looked up with a scornful grin at Tubal
Cain Sims, who seemed to entertain solicitude as
to the capacities for management and discipline of
Enott Blake, famous as the veriest martinet of a
drill-sergeant years before he ever saw the inside
of Kildeer County jail.</p>

<p>This absurd officiousness, however, met with
more leniency from the sheriff. Whether it was
that, from his steady diet of commendation, his
vanity could afford to dispense with such poor
crumbs as Tubal Cain Sims might have it in his
power to offer, or whether he was desirous of the
emollient effects of indulgence to loosen his visitor’s
tongue, he apparently took no heed of this
breach of the proprieties.</p>

<p>“He’s all right now. You needn’t have no
anxiety ’bout him,” he said, as if it were a matter
of course to be brought to book in this way.</p>

<p>“He can’t hurt himself nor any one else now,”
echoed the deputy, taking his cue.</p>

<p>Sims turned from one to the other inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Got him in a cage,” said the sheriff grimly.</p>

<p>For one moment Tubal Cain Sims silently
cursed his curiosity that had elicited this fact for
his knowledge and provision for future nightmares.
It was of the order of things that sets the natural
impulses of humanity and sympathy adverse to all
the necessities of law and justice. He stared at
the two officers, as if they were monsters. Perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
only his weapon, empty in the deputy’s pistol-pocket,
persuaded his apparent acquiescence.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” he gasped, “that’s powerful
tur’ble,—powerful tur’ble!”</p>

<p>The sheriff was no mind-reader. He deemed
that the allusion applied to the unjudicial hanging.</p>

<p>“Not so very,” he said, seating himself in a
splint-bottomed chair, and elevating his boots to
the topmost bar of the rusty, fireless grate.
“’Tain’t nigh so bad as havin’ ’em fire the jail,”
he added gloomily. “They have played that joke
on me five times. All this part o’ the buildin’ is
new. Burnt spang down the last time we had a
fire.”</p>

<p>“Take a chair, sir, take a chair,” said the conformable
deputy, perceiving that politeness had
come to be the order of the day.</p>

<p>Tubal Sims, almost paralyzed by the number
and character of the new impressions crowded
upon his unaccustomed old brain, still stood staring
from one to the other, his sunburned, grooved,
lank-jawed face showing a sharp contrast with his
shock of tow hair, which, having been yellow and
growing partially gray, seemed to have reverted to
the lighter tint that it had affected when he came
into the world. His hat was perched on the back
of his head, and now and then he reached up to
readjust it there; some subtle connection surely
exists between the hat of a man and his brain,
some obscure ganglion, for never does embarrassment
beset his intellect but the solicitous hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
travels straight to the outer integument. His
creased boots moved slowly forward with the jeans-clothed
continuations above them. He doubtfully
seized on the back of a chair, and, still gazing
from one to the other of his companions, deposited
himself with exaggerated caution on the stanch
wooden seat as if he half expected it to collapse
beneath him.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the sheriff smoothly, “you are a
sensible man, I know, an’ I wish you well.”</p>

<p>“How ’bout that thar pistol?” said Tubal Cain
Sims, instantly presuming upon this expression of
amity.</p>

<p>“I didn’t make that law,” said Enott Blake
testily. “But I’m here to enforce it, and you’ll
find that I know my duty an’ will do it.”</p>

<p>Tubal Sims relapsed into his friendless despair.
And once more the deputy essayed a new device.</p>

<p>He turned his round, red, freckled, good-natured
face full upon the visitor across the table, and,
pushing back his black hat from the blond tendrils
that overhung his forehead like an overgrown infant’s,
he said, fixing a grave blue eye upon Tubal
Sims, “You came here to tell us about some crime
you’ve s’picioned.”</p>

<p>The sheriff plucked up his faculties as if an
inspiration had smitten him. “You were going
to give us the names an’ fac’s as far as you knew
or they had developed,” he followed hard on the
heels of the pioneering deputy.</p>

<p>“You caved after you got here, ’cause you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
wished the man no harm, and the sight o’ the jail
sorter staggered you,” pursued the subordinate.</p>

<p>“But you had some personal motive,” interjected
the sheriff, suddenly solicitous for the verisimilitude
of the sketch of the interior workings of
Tubal Cain’s astounded intellect. “It has to be
a mighty plain, open case, with no s’picion ’bout
it, when information ain’t got some <i>personal</i> motive,—justifiable,
maybe, and without direct malice,
but <i>personal</i> motive.”</p>

<p>Tubal Cain Sims’s head turned from one to the
other with a pivotal action which was less suggestive
of muscles than of machinery. His eyes were
starting from beneath his shaggy, overhanging
eyebrows. His lower jaw had dropped. Thus
dangled before him, his own identity was as recognizable
to him as to their divination. If he had
had time to think, there might have seemed something
uncanny in this facile meddling with the
secrets of his inner consciousness, hardly so plain
to his own prognosis as in their exposition, but
moment by moment he was hurried on.</p>

<p>“Your personal motive in giving this information,”
continued the deputy, “is because you are
afraid of the man.”</p>

<p>“Not for myse’f,” blurted out Tubal Sims.
“Before Gawd, I’ll swear, not for myse’f.” He
was all unaware of an impending disclosure of the
facts that he had resolved to hide, since the horrors
of the jail, the true, visible presentment of
the abstract idea of imprisonment, had burst upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
his shuddering realization. He had forgotten his
caution. His obstinate reticence relaxed. All the
manhood within him roused to the alarm of the
possibility that these officers should impute to him
fear of any man for his own sake. He lifted a
trembling, stiffened old hand with a deprecatory
gesture. “Jes’ one—jes’ one darter!” He lowered
his voice in expostulation.</p>

<p>“One daughter!” echoed the sheriff in surprise.</p>

<p>“Gittin’ interestin’,” murmured the flippant
deputy.</p>

<p>“An’ this hyar man wants ter marry her, an’
she is willin’ ter marry him, an’—an’ he spoke
of runnin’ away.” Tubal Cain Sims brought this
enormity out with a sudden dilation of the eyes
irresistible to the impudent deputy.</p>

<p>“Powerful painful to the survivors!” he snorted
in a choking chuckle, “but not even a misdemeanor
agin the law o’ the land.”</p>

<p>The sheriff’s countenance changed. Not that
he apprehended any cause for mirth, for it might
be safely said that he had not laughed at a joke
for the past six years, and it would have been a
matter of some interest to know how he appraised
the cachinnation habitually going on all around
about him, and which he was temperamentally
debarred from sharing. His face merely took on
a perplexed and keenly inquisitive expression as
he bent his brow as to a worthy mystery.</p>

<p>“You know a man can’t be arrested for runnin’
away with a young woman an’ marryin’ her,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
expostulated. “You ain’t such a fool as to think
you can take the law to him to prevent that.”</p>

<p>There are few people in this world who do not
arrogate to themselves special mental supremacy.
Folly is like unto the jewel in the forehead of the
toad in that the creature thus endowed is unaware
of its possession. Tubal Cain Sims had perceived
subacutely the acumen of both the officers, and
was emulous of demonstrating his own intellectual
gifts. The word “fool” is a lash that stings, and,
smarting, he protested:—</p>

<p>“The law would purvent it mighty quick by not
waitin’ fur him, ef he hed commit crimes.”</p>

<p>“What’d he ever do?” demanded the sheriff
incredulously. And the deputy sat very still and
silent.</p>

<p>Now, the peculiarity of being literal-minded has
special reference to exoteric phenomena introduced
for mental contemplation, but is easily coexistent
with the evolution of an esoteric train of ideas,
the complication of which is nullified by familiarity
incident to their production. The sheriff was a
plain man, a serious-minded man, who could not
see a joke when it was before his nose; so literal-minded
a man that because he never perceived the
latent scheme of another, he himself was never
suspected of scheming.</p>

<p>“What’d he ever do?” he repeated, and it did
not occur to Tubal Cain Sims that he had not yet
mentioned the juggler’s name, nor so much as
suggested his own or the locality whence he came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“I ain’t keerin’ ter know <i>whut</i> he done!” he
asseverated, led on by the non-compliant look of
the other. “I <i>know</i> he done <i>somewhut</i>; an’
Phemie ain’t goin’ ter be ’lowed ter marry no evil-doer
an’ crim’nal agin the law.”</p>

<p>The pause that ensued was unbroken, while the
thunder rolled anew, and the dashing of the water
of the surly black creek at the foot of the hill
came to their ears. The sunshine on the floor
faded out suddenly and all at once, and the murky
gray light was devoid of any lingering shimmer.
If the deputy breathed, he did not hear the heaving
of his own chest, so still he was.</p>

<p>The sheriff, having allowed in vain a goodly
margin for continuance, went on abruptly: “That’s
the way you fellows, with no sense of the obligations
of the law, carry on. You have got no information
to give. You have got some personal
motive, an’ that’s the way to get an officer into
trouble,—false arrests an’ charges of stirrin’ up
of strife an’ such like,—an’ it’s personal motive
always. I’ll bet this man o’ yourn ain’t committed
no crime,” and he turned his calm gray
eyes on Tubal Cain Sims, seated in the midst of
his consciousness of a fool errand to the great
county town. Mortified pride surged to his face
in a scarlet flood, and vehement argument rose to
his lips.</p>

<p>“Why can’t he sleep quiet nights in his bed,
then?” he retorted. “Why do he holler out so
pitiful, fit ter split yer heart, in his sleep. ‘What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
can I do? For his life!—his life!—his life!
Oh, what can I do—for his life!—his life!—his
life’?”</p>

<p>The wind came surging against the windows
with a sudden burst of fury, and the sashes rattled.
As the gust passed to the different angles of the
house, the sound of other shaking casements came
from the rooms above and across the hall, dulled
with the distance, till a single remote vibration of
glass and wood told that even in the furthest cells
the inmates of this drear place might share the
gloomy influences of the storm, though fair weather
meant little to them, and naught the sweet o’
the year. A yellow flash, swift and sinister, illumined
the dull, gray room, that reverted instantly
into gloom, and, as if the lightning were resolved
into rain, the windows received a fusillade of hurtling
drops, and then their dusty, cobwebbed panes
were streaked with coursing rivulets mingling together
here and there as they ran.</p>

<p>The sheriff sat silently awaiting further disclosures,
his eyes on the window, his guarded thoughts
elsewhere. “The same words every night?” he
asked at last.</p>

<p>“The same words every night,” repeated Tubal
Cain reluctantly, as if making an admission.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t arrest a man for talking in his
sleep,” put in the deputy, with the air of flouting
the whole revelation as a triviality; and he yawned
with much verisimilitude, showing a very red
mouth inside and two rows of stanch white teeth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
“I ain’t sech a fool ez that, Mr. Dep’ty,”
snarled Tubal Sims raucously; “but puttin’ sech
ez that tergether with a pale face an’ blue circles
round the eyes, in the mornin’, o’ the stronges’,
finest-built, heartiest young rooster I ever seen in
my life,—he could fling you or the sher’ff from
hyar clean acrost that creek,—an’ layin’ on the
ruver-bank day arter day fishin’ with no bait on
his hook”—</p>

<p>“What’d he catch?” queried the deputy, affecting
anxious eagerness.</p>

<p>“All he expected, I reckon,” retorted Sims.
“A-layin’ thar, with his hat over his eyes, day
arter day; an’ his eyes looked ez tormented ez—ez
a deer I shot wunst ez couldn’t git up ter run
an’ couldn’t hurry up an’ die in time, an’ jes’ laid
thar an’ watched me an’ the dogs come up. An’
this man’s eyes looked jes’ like that deer’s,—an’
I never let the dogs worry him, but jes’ whipped
out my knife an’ cut his throat.”</p>

<p>The deputy’s eyes widened with pretended horror.
He snatched a pair of handcuffs from the
drawer at the side of the table, and, rising, exclaimed
dramatically, “You say, in cold blood, you
whipped out your knife and cut the man’s throat!”</p>

<p>“Ye think ye air powerful smart, Mr. Dep’ty,”
sneered Sims, out of countenance, nevertheless.
“But thar ain’t much credit in baitin’ an’ tormentin’
a man old enough ter be yer father,”
remembering the sheriff’s rebuke on this score,
and imputing to him a veneration for the aged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“Yes, stop that monkeyin’, Jeemes,” Blake solemnly
admonished his junior. Then, after silently
eying the rain still turbulently dashing against the
windows, he said reflectively, “Don’t ye think,
Mr.—Mr.—I disremember your name?”</p>

<p>“Sims,—Tubal Cain Sims,” replied the owner
of that appellation.</p>

<p>“Oh yes; Mr. Sims. Don’t you think the feller’s
jest a leetle lazy? There’s no law against
laziness, though it needs legislation, being a deal
more like the tap-root of evil than what money is,—though
I don’t set up my views against the
Good Book.”</p>

<p>“’Pears like ’twarn’t laziness, which may be a
sin, but makes men fat, an’ ez long ez the pot
holds out ter bile, happy. This man warn’t
happy nor fat, an’ he looked like the devils hed
thar home with him.”</p>

<p>“Where did he come from, and what’s his
name?”</p>

<p>“He ’lowed, one day, from Happy Valley, but
he didn’t know whar Happy Valley war. An’ he
talks like a town man, an’ reads a power, an’ tells
tales ez Phemie say air out o’ books; an’ he gin
a show”—</p>

<p>“A show?” the sheriff interrupted.</p>

<p>“A juggling show,” pursued Tubal Sims, in
higher feather since they no longer dissimulated
their absorption in these details. “He calls hisse’f
a juggler, though his name is John Leonard.”</p>

<p>“What’s he live on?” demanded the sheriff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>“The money he made at his show. He ’lowed
ter gin more shows, but the church folks gin it out
ez he war in league with Satan, an’ threatened ter
dump him in the ruver, so he quit jugglin’.”</p>

<p>The deputy with difficulty repressed a guffaw,
but asked, with a keen curiosity, “Was it a pretty
good show?”</p>

<p>“Ye never seen nuthin’ like it in yer life. He
jes’”—</p>

<p>“What sort of lookin’ man is he?” interrupted
the sheriff. He cast a glance at the deputy, who
unobtrusively began to busy himself with pen, ink,
and paper, and was presently scribbling briskly as
Tubal Cain Sims sought to describe the stranger.</p>

<p>“He looks some like a mountain feller now,” he
said. “He paid my wife ter make him some
clothes; but shucks!” his eye kindling with the
glow of discursive reminiscence, “the clothes he
kem thar in war a sight fur the jay-birds,—leetle
pants ez kem down no furder’n that, an’ long
stockin’s like a gal’s, an’ no mo’ ’shamed of ’em ’n
I am o’ my coat-collar; a striped black-an’-red
coat he hed on, an’ long, p’inted reddish shoes.”
He paused to laugh, while a glance of fiery excitement
and significance shot from the eyes of one
officer into those of the other.</p>

<p>Far better than Tubal Sims they knew how to
place the wearer of this sophisticated costume.
For although their bailiwick was the compass of
the county, their official duties carried them occasionally
to neighboring cities and their suburbs;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
and while rolling so rapidly was not conducive to
gathering moss for personal embellishment, it afforded
opportunity for observation not altogether
thrown away. This man was out of place,—a
wanderer, evidently; but whether a fugitive from
justice remained to be proved.</p>

<p>And while Tubal Cain Sims talked convulsively
on, hardly realizing whither his reminiscences led,
the expert penman was quietly noting down all the
personal traits of poor Lucien Royce,—his height,
his weight, his size, the color of his hair and eyes,
the quality of his complexion, the method of his
enunciation, and the polish of his manner,—all in
the due and accepted form of advertisement for
criminals, minus the alluring sum offered for their
apprehension by the governor of the State.</p>

<p>Tubal Cain Sims did not note the cessation of
the scraping of the pen, but the sheriff did, and
it was within a few moments that he said, “Well,
Mr. Sims, this offers no ground for arrestin’ the
man. But I’ll give you a piece of advice,—don’t
let him know of your errand here, or he’ll take
French leave of you and take the girl with him.
I can’t arrest him for you”—</p>

<p>“Courtin’ ’s the inalienable right of man, and,
in leap year, of woman too,” sputtered the deputy,
with his pen in his mouth and his laugh crowding
it.</p>

<p>“But,” continued the sheriff, “as I have some
business up that way, I may come over soon an’
look after him, myself. Say nothin’, though,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
about that, or you’ll lose your daughter,—just
one daughter.”</p>

<p>“One darter,” echoed Tubal Sims, his eyes absorbed
and docile as he followed the crafty officer’s
speech.</p>

<p>“Say nothin’ to nobody, and I’ll see you before
long.” Then suddenly leaving the subject, with
a briskening style he turned to the deputy.
“Jeemes, take Mr. Sims before a magistrate,—Squair
Purdy, I’d recommend,—on a charge of
carrying weepons with the intent o’ goin’ armed.
Let him know, though, Mr. Sims, ’twas in ignorance
of the law, and a-travelin’. Remind him
that the code says the statute is to be liberally
construed. And remember that Jeemes can’t
swear that old army pistol was <i>concealed</i> on <i>no
account</i>. <i>I</i> don’t b’lieve Jeemes kin make out a
case agin ye. Squair Purdy is mighty lenient.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you-uns goin’?” quavered Mr. Sims,
distrusting the tender mercies of the facetious
Jeemes.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied the sheriff, now far away in
the contemplation of other matters. “Jeemes, go
to the telephone and ring up the cap’n in Knoxville.
I want to speak to him.”</p>

<p>It only seemed a great babbling of a little bell
in the grim twilight of the hall of the jail as the
deputy piloted Tubal Cain Sims out of the door
which had so obdurately closed on him. And how
should his ignorance conceive that within three
minutes the chief of police in Knoxville was listening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
to the description of poor Lucien Royce, given
by the sheriff of Kildeer County, and trying for
his life to reconcile its dissimilarities with the physical
traits of various missing malefactors sadly
wanted by the police in divers localities?</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">X.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was with a mild countenance and a chastened
heart that Tubal Sims rode up to his own door the
next evening, and slowly dismounted, his old
brains, stiff with the limited uses of a narrow routine,
dazed and racked by the brisk pace which
they had been fain to conserve in the wide circuits
which they had traveled in his absence. Never
had the cabin on the river-bank looked so like
home; never had home seemed so like heaven.
For Tubal Cain Sims, in his secret soul, cared
little for the bedizenments of crowns, and the
superfluities of harps, and the extravagance of
streets paved with gold, and the like celestial scenery
of his primitive hymnology. The sight of
Jane Ann Sims on the porch, her bulky arms
akimbo, the flutter of Euphemia’s pink dress with
the dark red roses from the slope of the dell where
the spring lurked, could have been no dearer to
him if they had had wings,—which appurtenance,
however, in his lack of spiritual imagination,
would have reduced them to a turkey-like standpoint
or other gallinaceous level. He hardly remembered
to dread Jane Ann’s questionings; and
perhaps because of this beatific ease of mind, the
humble works of fiction, which the puritanical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
might denominate lies, that had occupied his faculties
during his return journey, were exploited with
a verisimilitude which received the meed of credulity.
He stated that the thought of Jerry Gryce,
his brother-in-law, and a paralytic, dwelling in
Piomingo Cove, had weighed so on his mind, in
wakeful hours of the night, that he had felt obliged
to rise betimes and journey thither to see that all
was well with him. And a cheerful report he was
able to give of that invalid,—for indeed he had
stopped in Piomingo Cove on the way back,—who
had charged him with some asperity, however,
being a superstitious man, to have a care how he
took the liberty of dreaming about him, or nourishing
presentiments in which he was concerned, or
viewing visions. “I kin do all my own dreamin’
an’ ghost-seein’ too, thanky kindly,” he had said
satirically.</p>

<p>Jane Ann Sims was the less penetrating as she
herself had developments of interest to detail. In
a wheezy, husky whisper that had less the elements
of confidential relation than a shriek might have
compassed, she made plain the altered state of
Euphemia’s affections and the understanding which
she and the juggler had reached.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how little mental capital a man
need possess to deceive the cleverest wife. Tubal
Cain Sims, seated in the open passage, tilted far
back against the wall in his chair, his saddle on
the floor beneath his dangling feet and his mare
cropping the grass beside the step, sustained every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
appropriate pose of surprised interest as successfully
as if Mrs. Sims’s story were new to his
ears. How could she, even if infinitely more
astute, have dreamed that it was the recital of
these same facts which he had overheard that had
sent him straight to Colbury with the instant determination
to have his would-be son-in-law incarcerated
on a criminal charge, before more romance
could come of the juggler’s stay in Etowah Cove?
She had expected opposition, having divined Tubal
Sims’s disapproval of his guest from his perturbed
and unwontedly crusty manner, and was scarcely
prepared for the mildly temporizing way in which
he received the disclosure.</p>

<p>“Humph—a—waal, we-uns will hev ter gin it
cornsideration, Jane Ann, a power o’ cornsideration,
an’”—he suddenly remembered his piety—“some
pray’r. Watch an’ pray, Jane Ann.”</p>

<p>“I’m ekal ter my prayin’ ’thout yer exhortin’s,”
she retorted, with proper spirit. “An’ ef
ye don’t wan ter set Phemie agin ye, ye’d better
do yer own prayin’ powerful private.” She could
not forbear this gibe, albeit at the idol of them
both. It was in graver and agitated mood that
she revealed how the idea of an elopement had
seemed to appeal to the young man’s mind,—so
much, indeed, that she began to fear he would
welcome any parental opposition which would
make it practicable. And here she found Tubal
Cain at one with her own thoughts, so a-quiver
with her own fears that she felt all at once bolder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
as if by communicating them they had mysteriously
exhaled. Not so Tubal Cain Sims. It is to be
doubted whether in all his life he was ever so earnestly
and markedly benign and courteous as when
he again met the juggler. His whole manner was
so charged with the sentiment of placation that
the young man’s quick discernment easily divined
his state of mind and his covert terrors. It eliminated
for the present any other course of action
than drifting along the smooth tides of love’s
young dream, for no elopement was possible when
there was naught from which to flee.</p>

<p>What wonderful days they were, as the full,
strong pulses of June began to beat with the fervors
of July! The long, ripe hours from early
dawn to the late-lingering twilight held all the
choicest flavors of the year. Never was the sunset
so gorgeously triumphal; never was the dawn so
dank with dew, so fresh of scent, so winged with
zephyrs. The wilderness rang to the song of the
thrush and of the mocking-bird, not less vocal
now than with the impulse of spring. The brimming
river yet ran deep in its rocky channel, and
the voice of the cascade below the mill in the full-leaved
joyous woods could be heard for miles on a
still night. And how still were these nights of
silent splendor, with the stars so whitely a-glitter
in the deep blue spaces above, and a romantic
mystery on the mute purple mountains below, and
the great bespangled gossamer Galaxy, as if veiling
some sanctity of heaven, scintillating through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
all the darkness! Not till late—till so late that
no one was awake to heed or behold—a yellow
waning moon with a weird glamour would glide
over the eastern summits, and in its precarious
hour before the flush of early dawn illumine the
world with some sad forecast, with slow troublous
augury of change and decline and darkness.</p>

<p>Flowers in myriads budded at night to blow in
the morning. Everywhere the strong, rich, vigorous
growths unfolded to the sun. The leaves
were thick in the woods, the shadows were dark
and cool, and rivulets glanced in the midst of them
like live leaping crystal. Anywhere down deep
ravines, did one look long enough, were to be seen
all the creatures of woodland poesy, evoked from
the glamours of the June,—hamadryads at their
bosky ease, and oreads among the craggy misty
heights, and naiads dabbling at the margin of sheltered
springs, and elves listening alert with pointed
ears to the piping of the wind in the reeds.</p>

<p>These June days seemed to Royce as if he held
them in perpetuity,—as if there could be no
change save for the slow enhancement of all the
charms of nature, bespeaking further perfections.
The past was so bitter; the present was so sweet;
and he thought no more of the future. He was
content. He had developed a certain adaptability
to the uncouth conditions of the simple life here,
or love had limited his observation and had concentrated
it. All the artificialities of his wonted
standards had fallen from him, and he was happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
in the simplest way. He wondered that he should
ever have thought the girl beautiful and charming
hitherto, so embellished was her loveliness now;
as if she too shared the ineffable radiance and
grace of the June, with the fair and faintly tinted
roses known as “the maiden’s-blush” that grew just
outside the door. He had told her that they were
like her, and when he learned the old-fashioned
name he wore one always stuck in the clumsy, ill-worked
buttonhole of his blue-checked cotton shirt.
So pervasive was the sentiment of happiness in
the house that it suffused even the consciousness
of the two old people; Jane Ann accepting it willingly
and with vicarious joy, and Tubal Cain
yielding after many a qualm of doubt and tremor
of fear, and still experiencing strong twinges of
remorse. He had been led to believe, by the
crafty sheriff’s show of indifference to his disclosure,
and repeated rejection as naught the significant
points of the suspicion he had entertained,
that he had been wrong from the first in his conclusion.
He had begun to argue from the officer’s
standpoint, and he was amazed and somewhat dismayed
to perceive how slight were the grounds on
which any reasonable charge could be based. As
this conviction grew more decided, he anticipated,
with an ever increasing terror, the possible visit of
which the sheriff had casually spoken. Although
he was sure now that, officially considered, it could
but be a flash in the pan, still it would reveal to
the juggler his host’s hideous suspicions and flagrant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
breach of hospitality, and from this Tubal
Sims winced as from corporeal pain. He thought
that the sheriff already considered him a preposterous
fool; and albeit that judgment from so great a
man—for Tubal Cain Sims’s self-conceit had been
much abated by his trip to Colbury—was humiliating
to his pride, it would be far more poignant,
multiplied by the number of inhabitants in the
Cove, when published abroad and entertained by
every man who dwelt in its vicinity. Moreover,
the disclosure of his mission to Colbury would
deliver the graceless informer, bound hand and
foot as it were, into the power of Jane Ann Sims,
and it might well alienate the juggler from them
all and thus wreck Euphemia’s happiness and prospects
in life; and he had begun of late to value
these. Whenever he was not mulishly resistant,
he fell much under the influence of Jane Ann Sims,
and her views of the preëminent qualities of the
juggler’s mind and manners and morals affected
his estimate. She laid great stress on the fact of
the young man’s elaborate education, and was wont
to toss her large head with a vertigo-provoking
lightness as she averred, “Phemie warn’t a-spellin’
year in an’ year out ter marry one o’ these hyar
Cove boys ez dunno B from bull-foot!” And Tubal
Cain would sneer in sympathetic scorn, as if
both he and his wife were not in precisely that
sublime state of ignorance themselves. He shared
her pride in a plan which the juggler had evolved
to open a school in the little “church-house” when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
the crops should be laid by, and in the fact that
this suggestion had met with the readiest acceptance
for miles around, despite the prejudice touching
his feats of magic.</p>

<p>One night, Jane Ann Sims, with the dish-cloth
in her hand, was alternately wiping the supper
dishes in the shed-room and cheerfully wheezing
breathless snatches of a most lugubrious hymn,
while Royce and Euphemia sat on the steps of the
passage, where the moon, now in her first quarter,
drew outlines of the vines on the floor,—with
here the similitude of a nest, whence now a wakeful,
watching head protruded, and now a lifted
wing, and now a downy, ball-like bulk; and here,
with indistinct verges, a cluster of quivering trumpet-flowers,
all dusky and blurring, like the smudging
black-and-white study of some impressionist
artist. Tubal Cain Sims, seeking company, was
aware, as he entered his domicile, that he would
find no welcome here, so he betook himself, with
his pipe in hand, to the leisurely scene of his help-meet’s
labors. There triumph awaited him, for
Jane Ann Sims left the table and the dishes to the
tallow dip and the candle-flies, to sink down in a
chair and detail the fact that while he was gone to
the blacksmith’s shop to get his team shod a wonderful
event had happened. Parson Tynes had
been here again!</p>

<p>Tubal Cain Sims’s lower jaw dropped. Parson
Tynes figured in his mind only as the troublous
advocate of a dead-and-gone love, and he thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
it a breach of the peace, in effect, to seek to disinter
and resuscitate this ill-starred attachment.
He growled adversely, but he did not reach the
point of articulate remonstrance, for Jane Ann
Sims majestically waved her limp dish-cloth at
him as a signal to desist, and opened her mouth
very wide to emit the cause of her prideful satisfaction
in a loud and wheezy whisper,—which discreet
demonstration came sibilantly to the ears of
the young people outside, the only other human
creatures within a mile, and occasioned them much
unfilial merriment.</p>

<p>Parson Tynes no longer dwelt on marrying and
giving in marriage. Ambition had been his theme.
It seemed that once, not long ago, being in Colbury
when a great revival—a union meeting of
various denominations—was held, he had had the
opportunity to preach there through some wild
rumor of his celebrity as a mountain orator; and
afterward a certain visiting elderly minister had
taken him aside and urged him to study and to
cultivate his gifts, and above all to acquire a delivery.
The visiting city minister, being a man
who appreciated the Great Smoky Mountains as a
large and impressive element of scenery, and having
never seen them except gracing the horizon, did
not realize that in all their commodiousness they
had scant accommodations for learning. On his
part, Tynes did not appreciate any especial superiority
in the delivery of the men he had heard.
His slow drawl and his mispronunciations were,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
of course, unperceived by him, and, speaking from
a worldly point of view, he was chiefly refreshed
at the meeting by the consciousness that there
were many more ideas in his sermon than in that
of the visiting city minister. He wondered satirically
how the good man would have received the
converse of this charge, had he dared to exhort
him in turn to cultivate thought and acquire ideas.
The meeting had done Tynes no good. It had
only hurt his pride, and roused a certain animosity
toward the larger world outside his life and the
round of his work, and caused him to contemn as
spurious the pretensions of the luckier clergy. He
did not accord the advice he had received a single
thought, so much more important it seemed to him
what a preacher says than how he says it. But
Jane Ann Sims had talked much and pridefully to
her cronies in the Cove about the juggler’s “readin’s,”
and their fame had reached the parson’s
ears. Shortly after, he chanced to encounter
Royce at the mill, and for the first time was impressed
by the charm of a cultured enunciation in
a naturally beautiful voice. “I’d like powerful
well ter speak like <i>that</i>, now,” he said to himself,
with a sudden discrimination of superiority. And
this afternoon he had come to say that he had
heard of the projected school, and that he would
like to know whether the juggler had ever been
taught elocution and was qualified to impart his
knowledge. Royce had read for him,—or rather,
had recited from memory,—and Tynes had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
surprised and delighted, and had averred that he
read “better’n all the men at the union meeting
shook up in a bag together, the city minister at
the bottom.”</p>

<p>“But ye would hev been s’prised, Tubal,” said
Mrs. Sims, her fat face clouding and her dimples
turning to creases, “ter hev viewed the gamesome
an’ jokified way ez John Leonard conducted hisself
ter the pa’son—plumb scandalous—made a
puffeck laffin’-match o’ the whole consarn; though
arter a while the pa’son seemed some less serious,
too. But he an’ John Leonard air a-goin’ ter
meet every day, beginnin’ day arter ter-morrer, in
the schoolhouse, ter take lessons in readin’. An’
the pa’son pays him fur it. Jes’ think o’ that!”
Her hand with the limp dish-cloth in it extended
itself impressively. “Teachin’ the pa’son—the
pa’son, mind ye—ter read!”</p>

<p>Tubal Cain Sims sat electrified by the honor.
Now and again his stiff old visage relaxed with a
broad smile, but this some grave thought suddenly
puckered up. In the midst of his satisfaction and
his appropriation of the honor that had descended
upon his house, ever and anon a secret thought of
his earlier distrust of the juggler intruded with a
vaguely haunting fear of the promised visit from
the sheriff. This he had latterly put from him,
for the long silence and the passage of time warranted
him in the conclusion that it had been
merely a device of the officer to satisfy a meddlesome
old fool, and was from the beginning devoid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
of intention. He hardly dared to wonder what
Jane Ann Sims would have thought of his suspicion,
as he remembered that from the moment of
the juggler’s entrance on that stormy evening she
had rated the young guest as highly as now. But
then, it had never been her chance to hear those
strange, mysterious utterances from the turmoils
of midnight dreams.</p>

<p>“Jane Ann,” Tubal Sims said, with quavering
solemnity, “I know this hyar young man be powerful
peart, an’ thar’s nobody in the kentry ter
ekal him, not even Pa’son Tynes; but what would
you-uns think ef ye war ter hear him call out, like
I hev done, in the night,—’way late, ’bout the
darkest hour,—‘But the one who lives!—fur
whose life!—his life!—fur his life!—what can I
do!—fur his life!—his life!—it must be!—his
life!’”</p>

<p>As he mimicked the cabalistic phrases that had
so strongly laid hold upon his imagination, the
very inflections of the agonized voice were duplicated.
The sentiment of mystery, of awe, with
which the air was wont to vibrate was imparted
anew. The despair, the remorse of the tones, sent
a responsive thrill like a fang into the listener’s
heart. Jane Ann Sims, her face blank and white,
sat staring dumbly as she hearkened. The leaves
darkly rustled close to the window. Dim moonlight
flecked the ground on the slope beyond with
shadow and a dull suffusive sheen. The wind,
rushing gustily past, bowed the flame of the guttering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
tallow dip, feebly flaring, in the centre of
the table. As she put out her hand mechanically
to shield it from extinction, the motion and the
trifling care seemed to restore her mental equilibrium.</p>

<p>“That sounds powerful cur’ous, Tubal,” she
said gravely, and his heart sank in disappointment
with the words and tone. He had expected Jane
Ann Sims to flout the matter aside loftily, and
indignantly decline to consider aught that might
reflect on her much-admired guest. It was he
himself who began to feel that it was of slight
moment and hardly worth detailing; the sheriff
had barely listened to it, without lifting an eyelash
of tired and drowsy eyes. He was sorry he
had told Jane Ann. What a pother women are
wont to stir up over a trifle!</p>

<p>“Why ain’t you-uns never spoke of it afore?”
she demanded.</p>

<p>“Kase I ’lowed ’twould set you-uns agin him,”
said the specious Tubal tentatively.</p>

<p>Jane Ann sniffed contemptuously. “Waal, I
ain’t been ’quainted with no men so powerful puffeck
in all thar ways ez I kin be sot agin a youngster,
what eats a hearty supper, fur talkin’ in his
sleep. I’d be a powerful admirer of the ‘sterner
sex,’ ez Pa’son Greenought calls ’em, ef I knowed
no wuss of ’em ’n that.”</p>

<p>“Wha—wha—what ye goin’ ter do ’bout’n it,
Jane Ann?” sputtered Tubal Cain, seeing her
ponderously rising, determination on her strong
features.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>“I be goin’ ter ax him what he means by it,
that’s what,” said Jane Ann. And before Tubal
Cain could protest, she was leaning out of the
window and wheezily calling to the young people
slowly strolling along the slope before the door.</p>

<p>“Kem in, chil’n. I want ter ax John Leonard
a kestion.”</p>

<p>She met him at the entrance of the passage, the
tallow dip in her hand, glowing with a divergent
aureola of white rays against the dusky brown
shadows and green leaves of the vines opposite.
He paused, expectant, while Euphemia, in her
green dress, stood on the sill amongst the swaying
vines, hardly distinguishable from them save for
her fair ethereal face, looking in as if from elf-land,
so subtly sweet was its reminiscent expression.
But he was intent of attitude, with a question
in his waiting eyes; not dallying mentally
with the thoughts he had had in contemplation,
but altogether receptive to a new theme.</p>

<p>His face changed subtly as Jane Ann Sims,
watching him narrowly, repeated the words of his
somnolent speech. “What air ye talkin’ ’bout,
John Leonard, whenst ye say them words agin an’
agin an’ agin, night arter night?” she asked him
inquisitively.</p>

<p>He did not hesitate. Still, he had a strange
look on his face, as if summoned many and many
a mile thence. “I dream that I am dead, sometimes,
and others need me back again, and I cannot
go. I can do nothing. I often dream that I
am dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>It so fell out the next day that this seemed no
dream. He was so surely dead that he walked
the ways of this world an alien. He was not more
of it than if the turf in the far cemetery, beside
the marble that bore his name, grew green and
lush with its first summer veritably above his
breast. He had no premonition of the deterioration
of the spurious animation which had of late
informed the days. The dawn came early, as was
its wont in these slow diurnal measures of July,
and cheer came with it. The explanation he had
given of his strange words was more than satisfactory,
and all about him was instinct with a sort
of radiant pleasure in him which diffused its glow
into his own heart.</p>

<p>As he stood in the passage lighting his pipe,
after breakfast, he noticed a salient change in the
landscape. No smoke was rising from the high
promontory where was situated the primitive kiln
of the lime-burners.</p>

<p>“Ye jes’ f’und that out?” said Tubal Cain,
with a chuckle, as, tilted against the wall in his
chair, he listlessly dangled his feet. “Thar ain’t
been no lime bu’nt thar fur six weeks.” He
chuckled anew, so cordially did he accept the sentimental
cause of the juggler’s lapse of observation.
“I reckon that thar lime is made up inter
morter an’ air settin’ up prideful ez plaister now,
an’ hev done furgot it ever war rock.”</p>

<p>The young man placidly endured the raillery;
in fact he relished it, for it was proof how genuine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
had been his absorption, and he was deprecatory
of self-deception. That alert commercial interest
never quite moribund prompted his next question.</p>

<p>“I don’t see that lime is used in the Cove,”
he said, reflecting on the stick-and-clay chimneys,
and the clay daubing in the chinking between the
logs of the walls of the houses. “What was the
purpose of that extensive burning of lime, Mr.
Sims?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you-uns hearn?” demanded the host,
with another cheerful grin expanding his corrugated
leathern-textured countenance. “Pete
Knowles wouldn’t tell a-fust; he got the job somehows.”</p>

<p>“Afraid of underbidding.” The juggler nodded
comprehension of the motive.</p>

<p>“So he bu’nt, an’ bu’nt, an’ bu’nt, an’ the
lime it piled up in heaps in that thar dry rock-house
what ’minds me powerful o’ the sepulturs
o’ the Bible. But it air six weeks sence they
bar’led it up an’ wagoned it off ’bout ten mile
or mo’.”</p>

<p>“What did they want it for, and who are
‘they’?” inquired Royce, still interested.</p>

<p>“‘They’ is them hotel men over yander at New
Helveshy Springs, an’ they wanted the lime ter
plaister the old hotel what hev hed ter be repaired
an’ nigh made over. They ’lowed ’twar cheaper
ter git the lime bu’nt at the nearest limestun rocks
’n ter buy it bar’led an’ haul it fifty mile from a
railroad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>This was a proposition of a kind that might well
secure the juggler’s business-like consideration.
But his eyes were fixed with a sudden untranslated
thought. His pipe had turned unheeded in
his hand, fire, tobacco, and ashes falling from it
into the dewy weeds below the step, as he stood on
the verge of the passage. His expressive face
had altered. It was smitten with some prophetic
thought, and had grown set and rigid.</p>

<p>“New Helvetia Springs! Summer resort, of
course. I didn’t know there was anything of the
sort in the vicinity,” he said at last. “What kind
of place is it?”</p>

<p>“I dunno!” exclaimed Sims, dangling his feet
briskly back and forth in an accession of contempt.
“<i>I</i> never tuk the trouble ter ride over thar in my
life, though I hev knowed the hotel ter be a-runnin’,
ez they call it, fur forty year an’ more.”</p>

<p>Royce stood in silence for a time, moodily leaning
his shoulder against the wall of the house, one
hand thrust in his leather belt, the other holding
the pipe at an angle and a poise which would seem
to precede an immediate return of the stem to his
mouth. But he did not smoke. Presently he put
the pipe into his pocket, drew his hat over his
eyes, and wandered down the road; then climbing
a fence or two, he was off in the woods, as safe
from interruption as if in the midst of a trackless
ocean. He walked far and fast with the constraint
of nervous energy, but hardly realizing the instinct
of flight which informed his muscles. When at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
last he flung himself down at the foot of great
rocks that stood high above a shelving slope in
woods so dense that he could not see farther than
a yard or two in any direction, for the flutter of
the multitudinous leaves and the shimmer of the
interfulgent sunshine, he was saying to himself
that he was well quit of all the associations of his
old world; that he had found safety here, a measure
of content, a means of livelihood, and the
prospect of a certain degree of simple happiness
when he should be married to a girl whom he had
learned to love and who loved him,—a beautiful
girl of innate refinement, who had mind enough to
understand him and to acquire an education. He
would do well to still resolutely that sudden plunging
of the heart which had beset him upon the
knowledge that his old world was so near at hand,
with all those endearing glamours as for the thing
that is native. What avail for him to hover
around them, to court the fate of the moth? He
remembered with a sort of terror the pangs of
nostalgia which at first had so preyed upon him,
and should he deliberately risk the renewal of
these poignant throes, now possibly spent forever?
Regret, danger, despair, lay in the way thither;
why should he long to look in upon scenes that
were now as reminiscences, so well could he predicate
them on experiences elsewhere? He wondered,
fretfully, however, and with a rising doubt
of himself, that when he and Euphemia had
climbed the mountain and looked down at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
shimmer of the small towns in the furthest valley,
and he had felt no stir of wistfulness, he should
have interpreted his tranquillity as a willing renunciation
of the life he had left,—as if the
treadmill limitations and deprivations and mental
stagnation of a village were the life he had left.
And suddenly—although he had chosen this spot
because it shut him in, because naught could be
seen to deflect his errant mind, in order that he
might realize and earnestly grapple with this wild
and troublous lure—the illusions of a sophistry
glimmered even in these scant spaces. He was
definitely reconciled, he told himself, to his destiny.
It was only his imagination that vaguely
yearned for the status he had left. With a touch
of reality the prismatic charms of this bubble of
fancy would collapse,—or the glimpse of conditions
native to him, the sound of familiar speech
as of his mother tongue, the sight of men and
women as compatriots in this long exile as of a
foreign land, would prove a refreshment, a tonic,
an elixir, renewing his strength to endure. He
was a coward to deprive himself—for fear of discontent—of
something to enjoy in the present, to
remember, and to look forward to, in recurrent
years.</p>

<p>He had not thought to notice the dwindling
shadows that betokened noon and the waiting dinner
which Euphemia had made ready with many
a remembrance of his preferences. The sun was
westering apace when, as if impelled by a force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
beyond his control, he found himself in the country
road, forging ahead with that long swift stride,
the envy of his comrades of the pedestrian club of
his urban days. His heart seemed to divine the
way, for he scarcely paused to debate which fork
to pursue when the road diverged; he gave no
heed to the laurel jungles on either hand, or,
further on, to the shady vistas under the towering
trees; he only perceived at last that the density
of the woods had diminished. Soon peaked and
turreted roofs appeared among the thinning boughs,
and as he crossed an elaborately rustic foot-bridge,
coquettishly picturesque, flung across a chasm
where deep in the brown damp shadows a silver
rill trickled, he recognized this as an outpost of
artificiality. A burst of music from a band thrilled
his unaccustomed ears; a vast panorama of purple
and azure mountains, a vermilion sun, a flaring
amber sky, great looming gray crags, and the
bronze-green sunlit woods beyond were asserted in
an unfolding landscape; he heard the laughter
cadenced to express the tempered mirth of polite
society, and the stir of talk. The verandas of the
two-storied hotel were full of well-dressed people.
His swiftly glancing eye marked the dowagers;
their very costumes were familiar,—black grenadines
or silks with a subdued inclination toward
a touch of lavender decoration, and some expert
softening of the ravages of time by the sparing
use of white chiffon or lace, with always something
choice in the selection of dainty shawls on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
back of a chair near at hand (how often had he
resignedly borne such a wrap over his arm in the
meek train of a pretty girl’s chaperon!): he knew
the type,—clever, discreet, discerning. On the
lawn two games of tennis were in progress, the
white of the flannel suits of the men enhanced in
the sun against the green grass. Along the road
beyond, two or three smart little carts were coming
in with the jauntiest of maidens in daintily tinted
summer attire and sailor hats. An equestrian
couple—the young man of a splendid physique
and elegantly mounted—went by him like a flash,
as he stood, dazed and staring, by the rail of the
bridge. He retained barely enough presence of
mind to dodge aside out of the way, and he received
a volley of sand, covering him from head to
foot, from the heels of the horses as they disappeared
in the woods at the steady hand-gallop.
On the crag at the verge of the bluff were groups
of young people, strolling about or seated on the
ledges of the cliff, the young men dangling their
feet over the abysses beneath, such being the accepted
fad; now and then, one not emerged from
the hobbledehoy chrysalis would, by means of
grotesque affectations of falling, elicit small complimentary
shrieks, half terror, half mirth, from
the extremely young ladies whom he favored with
his improving society. At one side there was a
meeting of fir boughs, a dank and cool dark vista,
a great piling of fractured and splintered rocks, a
sudden descent, and down this bosky way was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
constant a going and coming that Lucien Royce
divined that it led to the hidden spring.</p>

<p>He stared at the scene through the tears in his
eyes. To him who had never had a home it was
home, who had never dreamed of heaven it was
bliss. He would have given all he could imagine—but,
poor fellow, he had naught to give!—to
be able to communicate in some mysterious way
the knowledge of his quality to one of those high-nosed,
keen-eyed elder women, of composed features
and fine position and long social experience
and much discrimination in the world’s ways, and
to have her commend his course, and counsel
prudence, and pity his plight. He looked at the
elder men, whose type he also knew,—men of
weight in the business world, lawyers, bankers,
brokers,—and he thought what a boon might be
even the slightest impersonal conversation with
one of his own sphere, his equal in breeding, in
culture, in social standing. He was starved,—he
had not realized it; he was dying of mental inanition;
he was starved.</p>

<p>The next moment, two of the tennis-players,
ending the diversions of the afternoon with a
walk, approached the bridge: the man in his immaculate
white flannels, his racket carried over
his shoulder; the girl in her picturesque tennis
toggery. Royce, dusty, besprinkled with sand,
conscious of his coarse ill-made jeans clothes and
his great cowhide boots, colored to the roots of his
hair as their eyes fell upon him. In adaptation to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
the custom of the mountaineers, who never fail to
speak to a stranger in passing, they both murmured
a “Good-evening” as they went by. Royce, rousing
with a galvanic start, lifted his hat, hardly
realizing why they should glance at him in obvious
surprise and with elevated eyebrows. For one
moment he pondered fruitlessly on the significance
of this trifling incident. The solution of the mystery
came to him with a monition of added caution.
The social training of the mountaineer does
not comprise the ceremony of lifting the hat in
salutation. If he would sustain the rural character
he must needs have heed, since so slight a deflection
was marked. He heard them laughing as they
went, and he thought, with all the sensitiveness incident
to a false position, that he was the cause of
their mirth, the incongruity of this “million of
manners” with such a subject. With an aversion
to a repetition of this scene he betook himself out
of the way of further excursionists, noticing that
several couples were slowly strolling in the direction
of the bridge. But as he moved forward
from under the shadows of the fir and into the
clear space of the lawn, he could scarcely sustain
the observation which he felt leveled at him, Argus-eyed,
from the verandas, the lawn, the tennis-court,
the crags. His pride was in arms against
his humble plight. His face burned with shame
for his coarse garments, the dust, the very clumsiness
of his rough boots, the length of his overgrown
silky red-brown hair, his great awkward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
hat, the uncouth figure he cut in respectable society.
But despite the flush on his cheek, and a
thrill hot and tingling ever starting with each
searing thought to his eyes, as if tears were to be
shed but for the sheer shame of it, he laughed
scornfully at his pride, and despised himself to be
so poor, so forlorn, so outcast from his native
world, yet so yearning for it. “What does it
matter?” he said to himself. “They don’t know
me. Lucien Royce is dead,—dead forever.” He
walked on for a few minutes, the trained gait of
an athlete, his graceful bearing, the individuality
and distinction of his manner, all at their best,
mechanically asserted as an unrealized protest in
some sort that those lorgnettes on the verandas
should not conceive too meanly of him. “I suppose
I thought the ghost of a dude like Lucien
Royce would be a mighty well-set-up affair, with
a sort of spectral style about him and an unearthly
chic. But what does it matter what they think
of a nonentity of a stray mountaineer like this?
Lucien Royce is dead,—dead forever!”</p>

<p>He had merely ventured to partially skirt the
lawn, bending his steps toward the shelter of a
small two-storied building at the nearest corner of
it, and somewhat down the road. The lower portion
of this structure, he perceived, was used as a
store, containing a few dry goods, but dispensing
chiefly needles and pins, especially hairpins, and
such other commodities of toilet as the guests
might have forgotten or exhausted or could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
induced to buy. He paused in the doorway: even
the sight of the limited stock ranged decorously on
the shelves, the orderly counters, the smooth countenance
of the salesman, seemed pleasing to him,
as reminiscent of the privileges of civilization.</p>

<p>“Can we do anything for you, sir?” asked the
clerk suavely.</p>

<p>Royce caught himself with a start. Then speaking
with his teeth half closed to disguise his voice,
and drawling like a mountaineer, he said, shaking
his head, “Jes’ viewin’ the folks some.”</p>

<p>He had a sense that the imitation was ill done,
and glanced furtively at the face of the man
behind the counter. But the clerk was devoid
of speculation save as this faculty might explore
his customers’ pockets. Royce noted, however, a
second warning, and since the sun was down and
the lawn now depopulated, save for here and there
a hastening figure making for the deserted verandas,
he ventured out in his shabby gear upon the
plank walk that stretched along the bluff where no
crags intervened, but the descent was sheer to a
green and woodsy slope below. The early tea was
in progress; the band that for some time had been
heralding its service, playing within the quadrangle,
was silent now, and the shadows were
abroad in the mountains; mists were rising from
dank ravines on the opposite range. A star was
in the flushed sky. A whippoorwill’s plaintive
tones came once and again from the umbrageous
tangles that overshadowed the spring. Yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
lamps were flaring out into the purple dusk from
the great looming unsubstantial building. He
marked the springing into sudden brilliancy of a
row of windows on the ground floor, that revealed
a long, bare, empty apartment which he identified
as the ballroom. There would be dancing later
on. A cheerful clicking as of ivory against ivory
caused him to pause abruptly and peer down the
slope below, where a yellow radiance was aglow
amongst the trees and precipitous descents. It
came from the billiard-room in the pavilion, picturesquely
poised here among the rocks and chasms,
and looking out into a wild gorge that gave a
twilight view of the darkening valley, and the
purple glooms of the mountains towering along the
horizon. It was the airiest type of structure.
With only its peaked roof and its supporting timbers,
the floor and the flights of steps, it seemed
free to the breeze, so wide and long were the
windows, all broadly open. Royce, looking down
into its illuminated interior, glowing like a topaz
in the midst of the dark foliage that pressed close
about it, had a glimpse of the green cloth of the
tables, the red and white balls, the dexterously
poised cues, the alertly attitudinizing figures,—still
loitering in white flannels, although the lights
now agleam in bedroom windows told that all the
world had begun to dress for the ball,—and heard
the pleasant, mirthful voices.</p>

<p>Why did he linger here, he asked himself, as
he repressed the natural mundane interest which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
almost spoke out his criticism as he watched the
game with the eye of a connoisseur. This was not
for him. He was not of this world. He had
quitted it forever. And if he were mortified to
fill a place in a sphere so infinitely removed from
that to which he was born and entitled, would it
better matters to emerge from his decent obscurity
and his promised opportunities, his honest repute
and his simple happiness, to the conspicuous position
as the cynosure of all eyes in a criminal trial,
and to the permanent seclusion of a felon’s cell?
For that was what he risked in these hankerings
after the status and the sphere from which he was
cast out forever.</p>

<p>He was in the darkening road and plodding
homeward before this admonition to his own rebellious
heart was concluded, so did the terrors of that
possible ignominious fate dominate his pride, and
scorch his sensibility, and lay his honest self-respect
in the dust. He was tired. The drops stood
on his forehead and his step lagged. Thrice the
distance in the time he had walked it would not
have so reduced his strength as did the mental
perturbation, the inward questionings, those tumultuous
plungings of his strong young heart.
He was pale, and his face was lined and bore some
vague impress of the nervous stress he had sustained,
when at last he came up the steps of the
open passage at Sims’s house, and Jane Ann bent
her anxious flabby countenance toward him.</p>

<p>“Waal, before the Lawd!” she exclaimed, holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
the tallow dip in her hand so as to throw its
light full upon him,—and he divined that at frequent
intervals in the last two hours she had
emerged thus with the candle in her hand to listen
for his step,—“hyar the chile be at last! Whar
in the name o’ sense hev ye been, John Leonard?”
she demanded, as Phemie fluttered out,
pale and wistful despite her embarrassed laughter
at the folly of their fright, and old Tubal Cain
followed stiffly, with sundry grooves of anxiety
added to the normal corrugations of his face.</p>

<p>“In the woods,” replied the juggler; and then
realizing that he spoke with a covert meaning, “I
lost my way.”</p>

<p>He slept the sleep of exhaustion that night, and
the next morning he rose refreshed in body, and
with the resolutions of his sober reflections confirmed.</p>

<p>“I am not such a snob as to care for the mere
finery of existence, the mere wealth and show and
fashion,” he argued within himself. “It’s partly
the folly of my youth to care so much for those
young fools over yonder,—so much like myself,
or like what I used to be,—and dancing, and
tennis, and wheeling, and flirting, and frivolity.
A certain portion of these amenities has been the
furniture of my life hitherto, and I am a trifle
awkward at laying hold on it now without them.
I love the evidences of good breeding, because I
have been taught to respect them. I am prejudiced
in favor of certain personal refinements,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
because I was reared to think a breach of them as
iniquitous as to crash all the ten commandments
at one fell swoop. I revere culture and literary
or scientific achievement, because I appreciate
what they require in mental capacity, and I am
educated to gauge in a degree the quality of their
excellence. I should like to have some conversation,
occasionally, with people near my own calibre
in social status and mind, and with similar motives
and sentiments and way of looking at things. But
I <i>can</i> live without a ballroom and a billiard-table,
and, by the Lord, I’ll brace up like a man and do
it contentedly.”</p>

<p>He went off cheerfully enough, after breakfast,
to meet Tynes in the little schoolhouse. There
he recited, in forgetfulness of his troubles, poems
that he loved, and bits of ornate prose that he
recalled, for he had a good memory; and he delivered
sundry sound dicta touching the correct
method of opening the mouth and of the pose of
the body, and a dissertation on the physical structure
of the vocal organs, illustrated by diagrams
which he drew on the fly-leaf of the reading-book,
and which mightily astonished Absalom Tynes,
who learned for the first time that such things be.
The leaves of the low-swinging elms rustled at the
windows; the breeze came in and stirred up the
dust; the flying squirrel who nested in the king-post
of the roof, and who had had an early view
of the juggler upon his first appearance in this
house, came down and sat upon a beam and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
intent eyes gazed at him. Tynes, in an unaccustomed
station among the benches used by the congregation,
watched and listened with unqualified
commendation as Royce stood upon the platform
and made the little house ring with his strong,
melodious young voice. Abdicating the vantage-ground
of spiritual preëminence, Tynes subordinated
his own views, and when he read in his turn
sundry of the secular bits of verse embalmed in
the Reader—he seemed to think there were no
books in the world but school-books and the Bible—he
accepted corrections with the mildest docility,
and preserved a slavish imitation of the spirited
delivery of his preceptor. He rose into vigorous
rebellion, however, when, with many a
“Pshaw!” Royce rejected the continued use of
the elementary Reader for the vital defect of having
nothing in it fit to read, and took up, as matter
worthy of elocutionary art, the Bible. Tynes,
struck aghast by the change of delivery, the reverent,
repressed, almost overawed tones, the deep,
still gravity of the manner, listened for a time,
then openly protested.</p>

<p>“That ain’t no way ter read the Bible,” he
stoutly averred. “Ye hev got ter thunder it at
the sinner, an’ rest yer v’ice on this word an’ lay
it down on that, an’ lift it up”—</p>

<p>“Ding-dong it, you mean,” said the juggler,
shifting quickly to his habitual tone.</p>

<p>“The sinner ain’t ter be kep’ listenin’ ter sech
ez that. Jes’ let yer v’ice beat agin his ear till he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
can’t keep the gospel out ’thout he be deef,” Tynes
contended.</p>

<p>“Yes, and his senses accommodate themselves
to the clamor, and his consciousness sways back
and forth with the minister’s voice, and he doesn’t
hear more than one half of what is said, because
the fellow yells so loud that the sound drowns out
the sense. But the congregation looks pious, and
folds its arms, and rocks itself back and forth with
the rhythm of the sing-song, and the whole thing
is just one see-saw. Do you believe that’s the
way St. Paul preached on Mars’ hill?”</p>

<p>Tynes was suddenly bewildered. His manner
assumed a sort of bridling offense; it seemed somewhat
profane to speculate on the character of St.
Paul’s delivery.</p>

<p>“Your way ain’t the way the men read at the
Colbury revival, ennyhow,” he urged; for the union
meeting, despite his wounded pride, had become
a sort of standard.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet my old hat there wasn’t anybody there
who could come within a mile of my reading,”
glibly wagered the juggler, unabashed.</p>

<p>Tynes reflected doubtfully a moment. “I dunno
<i>what</i>’s the matter with it,” he said. “It hurts
me! I couldn’t git my cornsent ter read that-a-way.
It sounds like ye jes’ been thar yestiddy,
an’ it all happened fraish, an’ ye war tellin’ ’bout
it, an’ ye hedn’t got over the pain an’ the grief of
it yit—an’ mebbe ye never would.”</p>

<p>In the pause that ensued the juggler trifled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
the pages, his eyes cast down, a smile of gratified
vanity lurking in the lustrous pupils.</p>

<p>“Well,” Tynes said abruptly, “go on, John
Leonard, go on.”</p>

<p>But as the reading proceeded, the face of the
slight and pallid man sitting on the bench—now
and again wincing palpably from the scenes seemingly
enacted before him, from the old, old words
all instinct with the present, from the terrible
sense of the reality of those dread happenings of
the last night in Gethsemane, and the denial of
Peter, and the judgment-hall—all at once lighted
up with a new and vivid gleam of animation.
The chapter was at an end, the lingering musical
cadences of the reverent voice were dying away,
and as the reader lifted his head there were tears
in his eyes, and the fisher of men had seen them.</p>

<p>“Ye ain’t so far from the kingdom, John Leonard,”
he said, in solemn triumph.</p>

<p>The juggler recoiled in a sort of ashamed self-consciousness.
“Don’t deceive yourself!” he exclaimed.
“It is only my literary sensibility. All
the four Gospels—speaking profanely—are works
of high artistic merit, and they can floor me when
nothing else can.”</p>

<p>But the worldly ambition of Tynes had suddenly
fled. He was baiting his hook and reeling out his
line; here was the prospect of a precious capture
in the cause of religion. He might not learn to
read the Bible in John Leonard’s illusive and soul-compelling
way,—and he hardly knew if he cared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
to do this, so did it seem to penetrate into the
very mystery of sacred things which had less poignancy
under the veil of custom and indifference
and a dull sense of distance in time and place,—but
he would learn of him in secular things, he
would remain by him, and now and again insidiously
instill some sense of religious responsibility;
and the soul of this sinner would indeed be a slippery
fish if it could contrive to elude his vigilance
at last.</p>

<p>He listened indulgently as the juggler declared
he would have no more of the Reader, insisting
that such literature would wreck his mind. But
Tynes, for his own part, was not willing to trust
himself to learn the arts of elocution from the
sanctities of the Holy Book read with that immediate
and vital certainty which tore so at his heart-strings.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he said, his narrow, pallid face
brightening with the inspiration,—“I wonder ef
thar ain’t some o’ them books ye speak of over
yander ter the sto’ what that valley-man keeps at
New Helveshy Springs? They all bein’ valley
folks, mebbe he hev some valley books ter sell ter
’em.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt of it!” cried the juggler in
delighted anticipation. He looked down for a
moment, dubious of the wisdom of the course he
had in contemplation, but with a quick joy beating
at his heart. It was but natural, he argued within
himself, recognizing the access of pleasure, that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
young and debarred as he was from the society of
his equals, he should experience a satisfaction in
these fleeting glimpses of life as he had once known
it, and in its attraction for him was no harbinger
of regret and rue. Moreover, he judged that it
would excite less attention for him to buy the book
in person—he would make it appear that he was
on an errand for some cottager of the summer
sojourners—than if this ignorant parson should
overhaul the literature of the Springs, with some
wild tale of lessons from an elocutionary mountaineer.
As to danger, he would hold his tongue as
far as he might, and he deemed that he looked the
veriest mountain rustic in the garb he so despised.
“Rather a jaunty rural rooster, perhaps,” he said
to himself, “but as rural as a cornfield.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Royce</span> waited over one day after this agreement
with Tynes, and marked with satisfaction how
thoroughly his will was subject to his own control.
He had seen New Helvetia once. There was naturally
a certain mundane curiosity on his part to
be satisfied. Doubtless, after another excursion
or so thither, it would all pall upon him and he
would be more content, since there was no dream
of unattainable enchantments at hand upon which
he dared not look.</p>

<p>The place was singularly cheerful of aspect in
its matutinal guise. The slanting morning sunshine
struck through the foliage of the great oaks
and dense shrubs; but there was intervenient
shadow here, too, dank, grateful to the senses, for
the day already betokened the mounting mercury.
Across the valley the amethystine mountains shimmered
through the heated air; ever and anon
darkly purple simulacra of clouds went fleeing
along their vast sunlit slopes beneath the dazzling
white masses in the azure sky. In a ravine, a
tiny space of blue-green tint amongst the strong
full-fleshed dark verdure of the forests of July
bespoke a cornfield, and through a field-glass
might be descried the little log cabin with its delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
tendril of smoke, the home of the mountaineer
who tilled the soil. Of more distinct value in the
landscape was the yellow of the harvested wheatfields
in the nearer reaches of the valley, where
the bare spaces revealed the stage-road here and
there as it climbed the summits of red clay hills.</p>

<p>There was no sound of music on the air, the
band being off duty for the nonce. Even that
instrument of torture, the hotel piano, was silent.
The wind played through the meshes of the deserted
tennis-nets, and no clamor of rolling balls
thundered from the tenpin-alley, the low long roof
of which glimmered in the sunshine, down among
the laurel on the slope toward the gorge. The
whole life of the place was focused upon the veranda.
Royce’s reminiscent eye, gazing upon it
all as a fragment of the past as well as an evidence
of the present, discerned that some crisis of moment
impended in the continual conjugation of the
verb <i>s’amuser</i>. The usual laborious idleness of
fancy-work would hardly account for the unanimity
with which feminine heads were bent above
needles and threads and various sheer fabrics, or
for the interest with which the New Helvetia
youths watched the proceedings and self-sufficiently
proffered advice, despite the ebullitions of laughter,
scornful and superior, with which their sage counsel
was invariably received. There was now and
again an exclamation of triumph as a pair of conventionalized
wings were held aloft, completed,
fashioned of gauze and wire and profusely spangled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
with silver. He caught a sudden flash of
tinsel, and noted the special demonstrations of
congratulation and great glee which ensued when
one of the old ladies, fluttered with the anxiety of
the inventor, successfully fitted a silver crown upon
the golden locks of a poetic-faced young girl,
a very Titania. The jocose hobbledehoy whom
Royce had noted on the occasion of his previous
excursion sat upon a step of the long flight leading
from the veranda to the lawn, surrounded by half
a dozen little maidens, and, armed with a needle
and a long thread, affected to sew industriously,
rewarded by their shrieking exclamations of delight
in his funniness every time he grotesquely
drew out the needle with a great curve of his long
arm, or facetiously but futilely undertook to bite
the thread.</p>

<p>With zealous gallantry sundry of the young men
plied back and forth between the groups on the
veranda to facilitate the exchange of silks and
scissors, and occasionally trotted on similar errands,
businesslike and brisk, down the plank walk
to the store. Sometimes they asked here for the
wrong thing. Sometimes they forgot utterly what
they were to ask for, and a return trip was in
order. Sometimes they demanded some article a
stranger to invention, unheard of on sea or shore.
Thus cruelly was their ignorance of fabric played
upon by the ungrateful and freakish fair, and the
little store rang with laughter at the discomfiture
of the young Mercury so humbly bearing the messages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
of the deities on the veranda; for the store
was crowded, too, chiefly with ladies in the freshest
of morning costumes, and Royce, as he paused
at the door, realized that this was no time to claim
the attention of the smooth-faced clerk. That
functionary was as happy as a salesman ever gets
to be. There was not a yard of any material or
an article in his stock that did not stand a fair
chance of immediate purchase as wearing apparel
or stage properties. Tableaux, and a ball afterward
in the dress of one of the final pictures, were
in immediate contemplation, as Royce gathered
from the talk. This was evidently an undertaking
requiring some nerve on the part of its projectors,
in so remote a place, where no opportunities of
fancy costumes were attainable save what invention
might contrive out of the resources of a modern
summer wardrobe and the haphazard collections of
a watering-place store. Perhaps this added element
of jeopardy and doubt and discovery and the
triumphs of ingenuity heightened the zest of an
amusement which with all necessary appliances
might have been vapid indeed.</p>

<p>Royce could not even read the titles of the books
on the shelf at this distance, above the heads of
the press, and he turned away to await a more
convenient season, realizing that he had attracted
naught but most casual notice, and feeling at ease
to perceive, from one or two specimens to-day
about the place, that mountaineers from the immediate
vicinity were no rarity at New Helvetia;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
their errands to sell fruit to the guests or vegetables
or venison to the hotel being doubtless often
supplemented by a trifle of loitering to mark the
developments of a life so foreign to their experience.
As he strolled along the plank walk, his
supersensitive consciousness was somewhat assuaged
as by a sense of invisibility. Every one was too
much absorbed to notice him, and he in his true
self supported no responsibility, since poor Lucien
Royce was dead, and John Leonard was merely a
stray mountaineer, looking on wide-eyed at the
doings of the grand folk.</p>

<p>From that portion of the building which he had
learned contained the ballroom he heard the clatter
of hammer and nails. The stage was probably
in course of erection, and, idly following the sound
along a low deserted piazza toward one of the
wings, he stood at length in the doorway. He
gazed in listlessly at the group of carpenters working
at the staging, the frame being already up.
A blond young man, in white flannel trousers and
a pink-and-white-striped blazer, was descanting
with knowingness and much easy confidence of
manner upon the way in which the curtain should
draw, while the proprietor, grave, saturnine, with
a leaning toward simplicity of contrivance and
economy in execution, listened in non-committal
silence. The wind blew soft and free through the
opposite windows. Royce looked critically at the
floor of the ballroom. It was a good floor, a very
good floor. Finally he turned, with only a gentle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
melancholy in his forced renunciation of youthful
amusements, with the kind of sentiment, the sense
of far remove, which might animate the ghost of
one untimely snatched away, now vaguely awaiting
its ultimate fate. He continued to stroll along,
entering presently the quadrangle, and noting here
the grass and the trees and the broad walks; the
romping children about the band-stand in the
centre, dainty and fresh of costume and shrill of
voice; the chatting groups of old colored nurses
who supervised their play. One was pushing a
perambulator, in which a precocious infant, totally
ignoring passing adults, after the manner of his
kind, fixed an eager, intent, curious gaze upon another
infant in arms, who so returned this interested
scrutiny that his soft neck, as he twisted it over the
shoulder of his nurse, was in danger of dislocation.</p>

<p>“Tu’n roun’ yere, chile!” she admonished him
as if he were capable of understanding, while she
shifted him about in her arms to cut off the vision
of the object of interest. “Twis’ off yer hade
lak some ole owel, fus’ t’ing ye know; owel tu’n
his hade ef ye circle roun’ him, an’ tu’n an’ tu’n
till his ole fool hade drap off. Didn’ ye know
dat, honey? Set disher way. Dat’s nice!”</p>

<p>She almost ran against the juggler as she
rounded the corner. He caught the glance of her
eye, informed with that contempt for the poor
whites which is so marked a trait of negro character,
as she walked on, swaying gently from side to
side and crooning low to the baby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>He did not care to linger longer within the
premises. He could not even enjoy the relapse
into old sounds and sights in a guise in which
he was thought so meanly of, and which so ill
beseemed his birth and quality. When he issued
from the quadrangle, at the lower end of the
veranda, he found he was nearer the descent to
the spring than to the store. He thought he
would slip down that dank, bosky, deserted path,
make a circuit through the woods, and thus regain
the road homeward without risking further observation
and the laceration of his quivering pride.
False pride he thought it might be, but accoutred,
alas, with sensitive fibres, with alert and elastic
muscles for the writhings of torture, with delicate
membranes to shrivel and scorch and sear as if it
were quite genuine and a laudable possession.</p>

<p>The ferns with long wide-spreading fronds, and
great mossy boulders amongst the dense undergrowth,
pressed close on either hand, and the thick
interlacing boughs of trees overarched the precipitous
vista as he went down and down into its green-tinted
glooms. Now and again it curved and
sought a more level course, but outcropping ledges
interposed, making the way rugged, and soon cliffs
began to peer through the foliage, and on one side
they overhung the path; on the other side a precipice
lurked, glimpsed through boughs of trees
whose trunks were fifty feet lower on a slope beneath.
An abrupt turn,—the odor of ferns
blended with moisture came delicately, elusively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
fragrant; a great fracture yawned amidst the
rocks, and there, from a cleft stained deeply ochreous
with the oxide of iron, a crystal-clear rill fell
so continuously that it seemed to possess no faculty
of motion in its limpid interlacings and plaitings
as of silver threads; only below, where the natural
stone basin—hewn out by the constant beating of
the current on the solid rock—overflowed, could
the momentum and power of the water be inferred
from its swift escape, bounding over the precipice
and rushing off in great haste for the valley. The
proprietor had had the good taste to preserve the
woodland character of the place intact. No sign
that civilization had ever intruded here did Royce
mark, as he looked about, save a book on a rock
hard by. Some one had sought this sylvan solitude
for a quiet hour in the fascinations of its
pages.</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment, then advanced cautiously
and laid his hand upon it. How long, how
long—it seemed as if in another existence—since
he had had a book like this in his hand! He
caught its title eagerly, and the name of the
author. They were new to him. He turned the
pages with alert interest. The book had been
published since the date of his exile. Once more
he fluttered the leaves, and, like some famished,
thirsting wretch drinking in great eager gulps, he
began to absorb the contents, his eyes glowing like
coals, his breath hot, his hands trembling with
nervous haste, knowing that his time for this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
draught of elixir, this refreshment of his soul, was
brief, so brief. It would never do, for a man so
humbly clad as he was, to be caught reading with
evident delight a scholarly book like this. When
at last he threw himself down amongst the thick
and fragrant mint beside the rock, his shoulders
supported on an outcropping ledge, his hat fallen
on the ground, he had forgotten all thought of caution,
he was not conscious how the time sped by.
His eyes were alight, moving swiftly from side to
side of the page. His face glowed with responsive
enthusiasm to the high thought of the author.
His troubles had done much to chasten its expression
and had chiseled its features. It had never
been so serious, so intelligent, so refined, as now.
He did not see how the shadows shifted, till in this
umbrageous retreat a glittering lance of sunlight
pierced the green gloom. He was not even aware
of another presence, a sudden entrance. A young
lady, climbing up from the precipitous slope below,
started abruptly at sight of him, jeopardizing her
already uncertain footing, then stared for an instant
in blank amazement.</p>

<p>So precarious was the footing where she had
paused, however, that there was no safe choice but
to continue her ascent. He did not heed more the
rustle of her garments, as she struggled to the level
ground, than the rustle of the leaves, or the rattle
of the little avalanche of gravel as her foot upon
the verge dislodged the pebbles. Only when the
shaft of sunlight struck full upon her white piqué<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
dress, and the reflected glare was flung over the
page of the book and into his eyes with that refulgent
quality which a thick white fabric takes from
the sun, he glanced up at the dazzling apparition
with a galvanic start which jarred his every fibre.
He stared at her for one moment as if he were in
a dream; he had come from so far,—so very far!
Then he grasped his troublous identity, and sprang
to his feet in great embarrassment.</p>

<p>“I must apologize,” he said, with his most courteous
intonation, “for taking the liberty of reading
your book.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” she murmured civilly, but still
looking at him in much surprise and with intent
eyes.</p>

<p>Those eyes were blue and soft and lustrous; the
lashes were long and black; the eyebrows were so
fine, so perfect, so delicately arched, that they
might have justified the writing of sonnets in their
praise. That delicate small Roman nose one knew
instinctively she derived from a father who had
followed its prototype from one worldly advancement
to another, and into positions of special
financial trusts and high commercial consideration.
It would give distinction to her face in the years
to come, when her fresh and delicate lips should
fade, and that fluctuating sea-shell pink hue should
no longer embellish her cheek. Her complexion
was very fair. Her hair, densely black, showed
under the brim of the white sailor hat set straight
on her small head. She was tall and slender, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
wore her simple dress with an effect of finished
elegance. She had an air of much refinement and
unconscious dignity, and although, from her alert
volant pose, he inferred that she was ready to
terminate the interview, she did not move at once
when he had tendered the book and she had taken
it in her hand.</p>

<p>“I merely intended to glance at the title,” he
went on, still overwhelmed to be caught in this
literary poaching, and hampered by the consciousness
that his manner and his assumed identity had
become strangely at variance. “But I grew so
much interested that I—I—quite lost myself.”</p>

<p>She had some thought in mind as she looked
down at the book in her gloved hand, then at him.
The blood stung his cheek as he divined it. In
pity for his evident poverty and hankering for the
volume, she would fain have bid him keep it. But
with an exacting sense of conventionality, she said
suavely, though with impersonal inexpressiveness,
“It is no matter. I am glad it entertained you.
Good-morning.”</p>

<p>He bowed with distant and unpresuming politeness,
and as she walked, with a fine poise and a
quick elastic gait, along the shadowy green path,
vanishing at the first turn, he felt the blood beating
in his temples with such marked pulsation that
he could have counted the strokes as he stood.</p>

<p>Did she deem him, then, only a common mountaineer,
a graceless unlettered lout? She rated
him as less than the dust beneath her feet. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
could not endure that she should think of him
thus. How could she be so obtuse as to fail to
see that he was a gentleman for all his shabby
gear! It was in him for a moment to hasten after
her and reveal his name and quality, that she
might not look at him as a creature of no worth,
a being of a different sphere, hardly allied even to
the species she represented.</p>

<p>He was following on her path, when the reflex
sentiment struck him. “Am I mad?” he said to
himself. “Have I lost all sense of caution and
self-preservation?”</p>

<p>He stood panting and silent, the wounded look
in his eyes so intense that by some subtle sympathetic
influence they hurt him, as if in the tension
of a strain upon them, and he passed his
hand across them as he took his way back to the
spring.</p>

<p>Did he wish the lady to recognize his station in
life, and speculate touching his name? He was
fortunate in that she was so young, for to those of
more experience the incongruities of the interest
manifested by an uncouth and ignorant mountaineer
in a metaphysical book like that might indeed
advertise mystery and provoke inquiry. Was he
hurt because the lady, noting his flagrant poverty,
had evidently wished to bestow upon him the volume
which he had been reading with such delight,—so
little to her, so infinite to him? And should
he not appreciate her delicate sense of the appropriate,
that had forbidden this generosity, considering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
her youth, and the fact that he was a stranger
and seemingly a rustic clown? He rather wondered
at the scholarly bent of her taste in literature,
and her avoidance of the mirthful scenes of
the veranda, that she might spend the morning in
thought so fresh, so deep, so expansive. It hardly
seemed apposite to her age and the tale that the
thermometer told, for this was a book for study.
There was something simple-hearted in his acceptance
of this high intellectual ideal which all at
once she represented to him. A few months ago
he might have scoffed at it as a pose; he would at
least have surmised the fact,—a mistake had been
caused by a similarity of binding with that of a
popular novel of the day with which she had hoped
to while away the time in the cool recesses beside
the spring, and thus the volume had been thrown
discarded on the rock, while she climbed the slopes
searching for the Chilhowee lily.</p>

<p>The fire of humiliation still scorched his eyes,
and his deep depression was patent in his face and
figure, when he reached the Sims house at last,
and threw himself down in a chair in the passage.
One elbow was on the back of the chair, and he
rested his chin in his hand as he looked out gloomily
at the mountains that limited his world, and
wished that he had never seen them and might
never see them again. The house was full of the
odor of frying bacon, for there was no whiff of
wind in the Cove. The rooms were close and hot,
and the sun lay half across the floor, and burnt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
and shimmered, and dazzled the eye. The suffocating
odor of the blistering clapboards of the roof,
and of the reserves of breathless heat stored in the
attic, penetrated the spaces below. Jane Ann Sims
sat melting by degrees in the doorway, where, if a
draught were possible to the atmosphere from any
of the four quarters, she might be in its direct
route. Meantime she nodded oblivious, and her
great head and broad face dripping with moisture
wabbled helplessly on her bosom.</p>

<p>Euphemia, coming out suddenly with a pan of
peas to shell for dinner, and seeking a respite
from the heat of the fire, caught sight of Royce
with a radiant look of delight to which for his life
he could not respond. She was pallid and limp
with the work of preparing dinner, and even in
the poetic entanglements of her curling shining
hair she brought that most persistent aroma of the
frying-pan. The coarse florid calico, the misshapen
little brogans which she adjusted on the
rung of her chair as she tilted it back against the
wall with the pan in her lap, her drawling voice,
the lapses of her ignorant speech, her utter lack
of all the graces of training and culture, impressed
him anew with the urgency of a fresh discovery.</p>

<p>“What air it ez ails you-uns?” she demanded,
with a certain anxiety in her eyes. “Ye hev acted
sorter cur’ous all this week. Do you-uns feel sick
ennywhars?”</p>

<p>“Lord, no!” exclaimed the juggler irritably;
“there’s nothing the matter with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>She looked at him in amazement for a moment;
he had had no words for her of late but honeyed
praise. The change was sudden and bitter. There
was an appealing protest in her frightened eyes,
and the color rushed to her face.</p>

<p>He had no affinities for the rôle of fickle-minded
lover, and he was hardly likely to seek to palliate
the cruelty of inconstancy. He took extreme
pride in being a man of his word. The sense of
honor, which was all the religion he had and
chiefly active commercially, was evident too in his
personal affairs. Was it her fault, he argued, his
poor little love, that she was so hopelessly rustic?
Had he not sought her when she was averse to
him, and won her heart from a man she loved,
who would never have thought himself too good
for her? He would not apologize, however. He
would not let her think that he had been vexed
into hasty speech by the mere sight of her, the
sound of her voice.</p>

<p>“You just keep that up,” he said, conserving
an expression of animosity before which she visibly
quaked, “and you’ll have Mrs. Sims brewing her
infernal herb teas for me in about three minutes
and a quarter. I want you to stop talking about
my being ill, short off.”</p>

<p>As she gazed at him she burst into a little trill
of treble laughter, that had nevertheless the suggestion
of tears ready to be shed, in the extremity
of her relief.</p>

<p>“I have walked twenty miles to-day, and it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
a goodish tramp in the heat of the day,—over to
New Helvetia and back; and I’m fagged out,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>Her equilibrium was restored once more, and
her eyes were radiant with the joy of loving and
being loved. Yet she paused suddenly, her hand—he
winced that he should notice how rough and
large it was, the nails blunt and short and broad—resting
motionless on the edge of the pan, as
she said, “I wisht ye would gin up goin’ ter that
thar hotel. Ye look strange ter-day,”—her eyes
searched his face as if for an interpretation of
something troublous, daunting,—“so strange! so
strange!”</p>

<p>“How?” he demanded angrily, knitting his
brows.</p>

<p>“Ez ef—ef ye bed been ’witched somehows,”
she answered, “like I ’low folks mus’ look ez
view a witch in the woods an’ git under some unyearthly
spell. The woods air powerful thick
over to’des New Helveshy, an’ folks ’low they air
fairly roamin’ with witches an’ sech. I ain’t
goin’ ter gin my cornsent fur ye ter go through ’em
no mo’.”</p>

<p>She pressed a pod softly, and the peas flew out
and rattled in the pan, and the tension was at an
end. He felt that she was far too acute, however.
He was sorry she had ever known of his visits
to New Helvetia. She should suppose them discontinued.
He certainly coveted no feminine
espionage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>He could not escape the thought of the place
now. The face of the beautiful stranger was before
his eyes every waking hour; and there were
many, for the nights had lost their balm of sleep.
The tones of her voice sounded in his ear. The
delicate values of her refined bearing, the suggestions
of culture and charm and high breeding
which breathed from her presence like a perfume,
had enthralled his senses as might the subtle and
aerial potencies of ether. He had no more volition.
He could not resist. Yet it was not, he
stipulated, this stranger whom he adored. It was
what she represented. He perceived at last that
for him the artificialities of life were the realities.
Even his own cherished gifts were matters of sedulous
cultivation of certain natural aptitudes, the
training of which was more remarkable than the
endowment; and indeed, of what worth the latent
talent without that culture which gives it use, and
in fact recognized being at all? The status had
an inherent integral value, the human creature was
its mere incident. Nature was naught to him.
The triumphs of the world are the uses man has
made of nature; the forces that have lifted him
from plane to plane, and sublimated the mere intelligence,
which he shares with the beast, into intellectuality,
which is the extremest development
of mind.</p>

<p>As he argued thus abstractly, the longing to see
her again grew resistless. Not himself to be seen,
and never, never again by her! He would only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
look at her from afar, as one—even so humble a
wretch—might gaze at some masterpiece of the
artist’s craft, might kneel in abasement and self-abnegation
before some noble shrine. He craved
to see her in her splendid young loveliness and
girlish enjoyment, in gala attire, at the grand fête
on which the youth of New Helvetia were expending
their ingenuity of invention and expansive
energy. Even prudence could not say him nay.
Did fate grudge him a glimpse that he might gain
at the door, or while between the dances she walked
with her partner on the moonlit veranda? Who
would note a flitting ghost, congener of the shadow,
lurking in the deep glooms beneath the trees and
looking wistfully at the world from which he had
been snatched away?</p>

<p>It was with a lacerating sense of renunciation
that he parted with each instant of the time during
the momentous evening when he might have beheld
her in the tableaux; for he could with certainty fix
upon the place she occupied, having gathered from
the talk at the store the date and order of the
festivities. But he could not rid himself of the
Sims family. It had been vaguely borne in upon
Mrs. Sims that he was growing tired of them, and
in sudden alarm lest Euphemia’s happiness prove
precarious, and with that disposition to assume the
blame not properly chargeable to one’s self which
is common to some good people, who perceive no
turpitude in lying when the deceit is practiced only
on themselves, she made herself believe that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
change was merely because she had been remiss in
her attentions to her guest, and had treated him
too much and too informally as one of the family.
She smiled broadly upon him, with each of her
many dimples in evidence, which had never won
upon him, even in the days of his blandest contentment.
She detained him in conversation.
She requested that he would favor her with the
exact rendition of the air to which he sang the
words of Rock of Ages, one Sunday morning when
he had heard the bells of the St. Louis church
towers ringing from out the misty west; and as
he dully complied, his tones breaking more than
once, she accommodatingly wheezed along with
him, quite secure of his commendation. For Jane
Ann Sims had been a “plumb special singer”
when she was young and slim, and no matter how
intelligent a woman may be, she never outgrows
her attractions—in her own eyes.</p>

<p>At last the house was still, and the juggler,
having endured an agony of suspense in his determination
to suppress all demonstrations of interest
in New Helvetia, lest the intuition of the two
women should divine the cause from even so slight
indicia as might baffle reason, found himself free
from question and surmise and comment. He
was off in the darkness, with a furtive noiseless
speed, like some wild errant thing of the night,
native to the woods. He had a sense of the
shadow and of the sheen of a fair young moon in
the wilderness; he knew that the air was dank and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
cool and that the dew fell; he took note mechanically
of the savage densities of the wilds when he
heard the shrill blood-curdling quavering of a
catamount’s scream, and he laid his grasp on the
handle of a sharp bowie-knife that he wore in his
belt, which he had bought for a juggling trick that
he had not played at the curtailed performance in
the schoolhouse, and he wished that it were instead
Tubal Cain’s shooting-iron. But beyond this his
mind was a blank. He did not think; he did not
feel; his every capacity was concentrated upon his
gait and the speed that he made. He did not
know how short a time had elapsed when the series
of points of yellow light from the ballroom windows,
like a chain of glowing topaz, shone through
the black darkness and the misty tremulous dimness
of the moon. His teeth were set; he was
fit to fall; he paused only a moment, leaning on
the rail of the bridge to draw a deep breath and relax
his muscles. Then he came on, swift, silent,
steady, to the veranda.</p>

<p>Around the doors, outside the ballroom, were
crowded figures, whose dusky faces and ivory teeth
caught the light from within and attested the enjoyment
of the servants of the place as spectators
of the scene. He saw through an aperture, as one
of them moved aside, a humble back bench against
the wall, on which sat two or three of the mountaineers
of the vicinity, calmly and stolidly looking
on, without more facial expression of opinion than
Indians might have manifested. He would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
join this group, lest she might notice him in their
company, which he repudiated, as if his similarity
of aspect were not his reliance to save all that he
and men of his kind held dear. The windows were
too high from the ground to afford a glimpse of the
interior; he stood irresolute for a moment, with
the strains of the waltz music vibrating in his very
heart-strings. Suddenly he marked how the ground
rose toward the further end of the building. The
last two windows evidently were partially blockaded
by the slope so close without, and could serve only
purposes of ventilation. Responsive to the thought,
he climbed the steep slant, dark, dewy, and solitary,
and, lying in the soft lush grass, looked down
upon the illuminated ballroom.</p>

<p>At first he did not see her. With his heart
thumping much after the fashion of the bass viol,
till it seemed to beat in his ears, he gazed on the
details of a scene such as he had thought never to
look upon again. He recognized with a sort of
community spirit and pleasure how well the frolicsome
youth had utilized their slender opportunities,
so far from the emporiums of civilization.
Great branching ferns had adequately enough supplied
the place of palms, their fronds waving
lightly from the walls in every whirling breeze
from the flight of the dance. Infinite lengths of
vines—the Virginia creeper, the ground ivy, and
the wild grape—twined about the pillars, and
festooned the ceiling, the band-stand, and the
chandeliers. For the first time he was made aware<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
of the decorative values of the blackberry, when
it is red, and, paradoxically, green. The unripe
scarlet clusters were everywhere massed amidst the
vines with an effect as brilliant as holly. All the
aisles of the surrounding woods had been explored
for wild flowers. Here and there were tables laden
with great masses of delicate blossoms, and from
time to time young couples paused in their aimless
strolling back and forth,—for the music had ceased
for the nonce,—and examined specimens, and disputed
over varieties, and apparently disparaged
one another’s slender scraps of botany.</p>

<p>The band, high in their cage,—prosperous,
pompous darkies, of lofty manners, but entertaining
with an air of courteous condescension any
request which might be preferred, in regard to the
music, by the young guests of the hotel,—looked
down upon the scene complacently. Against the
walls were ranged the chaperons in their most
festal black attire, enhanced by fine old lace and
fragile glittering fans and a somewhat dazzling
display of diamonds. The portly husbands and
fathers, fitting very snugly in their dress suits,
hovered about these borders with that freshened
relish of scenes of youthful festivity which somehow
seems increased in proportion as the possibility
and privilege of participation are withdrawn.
Some of the younger gentlemen also wore merely
the ordinary evening dress, the difficulty of evolving
a fancy costume, or a secret aversion to the
characters they had represented in the tableaux,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
warranting this departure from the spirit of the
occasion.</p>

<p>Everywhere, however, the younger feminine
element blossomed out in poetic guise. Here and
there fluttered fairies with the silver-flecked game
wings that Royce had seen a-making, and Titania
still wore her crown, although Bottom had thrown
his pasteboard head out of the window, and was
now a grave and sedate young American citizen.
Red Riding-Hood and the Wolf still made the
grand tour in amicable company, and Pocahontas,
in a fawn-tinted cycling-skirt and leggings and a
red blanket bedizened with all the borrowed beads
and feathers that the Springs could afford, was
esteemed characteristic indeed. Davy Crockett
had a real coonskin cap which he had bought for
lucre from a mountaineer, and which he intended
to take home as a souvenir of the Great Smokies,
although he was fain to carry it now by the tail
because of the heat; but he invariably put it on
and drew himself up to his tableau estimate of
importance whenever one of the elderly ladies
clutched at him, as he passed, to inquire if he
were certainly sure that the long and ancient flintlock
(borrowed) which he bore over his shoulder
was unloaded. There had evidently been a tableau
representing Flora’s court or similar blooming
theme, since so many personified flowers were
wasting their sweetness on the unobservant and
unaccustomed air. The wild rose was in several
shades of fleecy pink, festooned with her own garlands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
A wallflower—a dashing blonde—was in
brown and yellow, and had half the men in the
room around her.</p>

<p>Suddenly—Lucien Royce’s heart gave a great
throb and seemed to stand still, for, on the arm of
her last partner, coming slowly down the room
until she stood in the full glow of the nearest chandelier,
all in white, in shining white satin, with a
grace and dignity which embellished her youth,
was she whom he had so longed to see. Her bare
arms and shoulders were of a soft whiteness that
made the tone of the satin by contrast glazing and
hard. Her delicate head, with its black hair
arranged close and high, had the pose of a lily on
its stalk. Scattered amid the dense dark tresses
diamonds glittered and quivered like dewdrops.
Her face had that flower-like look not uncommon
among the type of the very fair women with dark
hair from the extreme South. Over the white
satin was some filmy thin material, like the delicate
tissues of a corolla; and only when he had
marked these liliaceous similitudes did he observe
that it was the Chilhowee lily which she had
chosen to represent. Now and again that most
ethereal flower showed amongst the folds of her
skirt. A cluster as fragile as a dream lay on her
bosom, and in her hand she carried a single blossom,
poetic and perfect, trembling on its long
stalk.</p>

<p>There rose upon the air a soft welling out of
the music. The band was playing “Home, Sweet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
Home.” She had moved out of the range of his
vision. There was a murmur of voices on the
veranda as the crowd emerged. The lights were
abruptly quenched in darkness. And he laid his
head face downward in the deep grass and wished
he might never lift it again.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Owen Haines</span> spent many a lonely hour, in
these days, at the foot of a great tree in the woods,
riving poplar shingles. Near by in the green and
gold glinting of the breeze-swept undergrowth another
great tree lay prone on the ground. The
space around him was covered with the chips hewn
from its hole,—an illuminated yellow-hued carpet
in the soft wavering emerald shadows. The smooth
shingles, piled close at hand, multiplied rapidly as
the sharp blade glided swiftly through the poplar
fibres. From time to time he glanced up expectantly,
vainly looking for Absalom Tynes; for it
had once been the wont of the young preacher to
lie here on the clean fresh chips and talk through
much of the sunlit days to his friend, who welcomed
him as a desert might welcome a summer
shower. He would talk on the subject nearest the
hearts of both, his primitive theology,—a subject
from which Owen Haines was otherwise debarred,
as no other ministerial magnate would condescend
to hold conversation on such a theme with the
laughing-stock of the meetings, whose aspirations
it was held to be a duty in the cause of religion to
discourage and destroy if might be. Only Tynes
understood him, hoped for him, felt with him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
But Tynes was now at the schoolhouse in the
Cove, listening in fascinated interest to the juggler
as he recited from memory, and himself reading
in eager and earnest docility, copying his master’s
methods.</p>

<p>Therefore, when the step of a man sounded
along the bosky path which Haines had worn to
his working-place, and he looked up with eager anticipation,
he encountered only disappointment at
the sight of Peter Knowles approaching through
the leaves.</p>

<p>Knowles paused and glanced about him with
withering disdain. “Tynes ain’t hyar,” he observed.
“I dunno ez I looked ter view him,
nuther.”</p>

<p>He dropped down on the fragrant carpet of
chips, and for the first time Haines noticed that
he carried, after a gingerly fashion, on the end of
a stick, a bundle apparently of clothes, and plentifully
dusted with something white and powdery.
Even in the open air and the rush of the summer
wind the odor exhaled by quicklime was powerful
and pungent, and the scorching particles came
flying into Haines’s face. As he drew back
Knowles noticed the gesture, and adroitly flung
the bundle and stick to leeward, saying, “Don’t it
’pear plumb cur’ous ter you-uns, the idee o’ a
minister o’ the gorspel a-settin’ out ter l’arn how
ter read the Bible from a onconverted sinner? I
hearn this hyar juggler-man ’low ez he warn’t even
a mourner, though he said he hed suthin’ ter mourn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
over. An’ I’ll sw’ar he hev,” he added significantly,
“an’ he may look ter hev more.”</p>

<p>The poplar slivers flew fast from the keen blade,
and the workman’s eyes were steadfastly fixed on
the shingle growing in his hand.</p>

<p>Peter Knowles chewed hard on his quid of tobacco
for a moment; then he broke out abruptly,
“Owen Haines, I knows ye want ter sarve the
Lord, an’ thar’s many a way o’ doin’ it besides
preachin’, else I’d be a-preachin’ myself.”</p>

<p>Such was the hold that his aspiration had taken
upon Haines’s mind that he lifted his head in
sudden expectancy and with a certain radiant submissiveness
on his face, as if his Master’s will
could come even by Peter Knowles!</p>

<p>“I brung ye yer chance,” continued Knowles.
Then, with a quick change from a sanctimonious
whine to an eager, sharp tone full of excitement,
“What ye reckon air in that bundle?”</p>

<p>Haines, surprised at this turn of the conversation,
glanced around at the bundle in silence.</p>

<p>“An’ whar do ye reckon I got it?” asked
Knowles. Then, as Owen Haines’s eyes expressed
a wondering question, he went on, mysteriously
lowering his voice, “I fund it in my rock-house,—that
big cave o’ mine whar I stored away the
lime I burned on the side o’ the mounting—this
bundle war flung in thar an’ kivered by quicklime!”</p>

<p>Haines stared in blank amazement for a moment.
“I ’lowed ye hed plugged up the hole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
goin’ inter yer cave, ter keep the lime dry, with a
big boulder.”</p>

<p>“Edzac’ly, edzac’ly!” Knowles assented, his
close-set eyes so intent upon Haines as to put him
out of countenance in some degree.</p>

<p>Haines sought to withdraw his glance from their
baleful significant expression, but his eyelids faltered
and quivered, and he continued to look wincingly
at his interlocutor. “I ’lowed ’twar too
heavy for enny one man ter move,” he commented
vaguely, at last.</p>

<p>“’Thout he war helped by the devil,” Knowles
stipulated.</p>

<p>There was a pause. The young workman’s
hand was still. His companion’s society did not
accord with his mood. The loneliness had been
soft and sweet, and of peaceful intimations. His
frequent disappointments were of protean guise.
Where was that work for the Master that Peter
Knowles had promised him?</p>

<p>“Owen Haines,” cried Peter Knowles suddenly,
“hev that thar man what calls hisself a juggler-man
done ennythin’ but harm sence he hev been
in the Cove an’ the mountings?”</p>

<p>Haines, the color flaring to his brow, laid quick
hold on his shingle-knife and rived the wood apart;
his breath came fast and his hand shook, although
his work was steady. He was all unnoting that
Peter Knowles was watching him with an unguarded
eye of open amusement, and a silent sneer
that left long tobacco-stained teeth visible below<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
the curling upper lip. But a young fool’s folly is
often propitious for the plans of a wiser man, and
Knowles was not ill pleased to descry the fact that
the relations between the two could not admit of
friendship, or tolerance, or even indifference.</p>

<p>“Fust,” he continued, “he gin that onholy show
in the church-house, what I never seen, but it hev
set folks powerful catawampus an’ hendered religion,
fur the devil war surely in it.”</p>

<p>Owen Haines took off his hat to toss his long
fair hair back from his brow, and looked with
troubled, reflective eyes down the long aisles of the
gold-flecked verdure of the woods.</p>

<p>“Then he tricked you-uns somehows out’n yer
sweetheart, what ye hed been keepin’ company
with so long.”</p>

<p>Haines shook his head doubtfully. “We-uns
quar’led,” he said. “I dunno ef he hed nuthin’
ter do with it.”</p>

<p>“Did Phemie an’ you-uns ever quar’l ’fore he
kem ter Sims’s?” demanded the sly Knowles.</p>

<p>They had never quarreled before Haines “got
religion” and took to “prayin’ fur the power.”
He had never thought the juggler chargeable with
these differences, but the fallacy now occurred to
him that they might have been precipitated by
Royce’s ridicule of him as a wily device to rid
her of her lover. His face grew hot and angry.
There was fire in his eyes. His lips parted and
his breath came quick.</p>

<p>“He hev toled off Tynes too,” resumed Knowles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
with a melancholy intonation. “He hev got all
the lures and witchments of the devil at command.
I kem by the church-house awhile ago, an’ I hearn
him an’ Tynes in thar, speakin’ an’ readin’. An’
I sez ter myself, sez I, ‘Pore Owen Haines, up
yander in the woods, hev got nuther his frien’,
now, nor his sweetheart. Him an’ Phemie keeps
company no mo’ in this worl’.’”</p>

<p>There was a sudden twitch of Haines’s features,
as if these piercing words had been with some
material sharpness thrust in amongst sensitive tissues.
It was all true, all true.</p>

<p>The iron was hot, and Peter Knowles struck.
“That ain’t the wust,” he said, leaning forward
and bringing his face with blazing eyes close to
his companion. “This hyar juggler hev killed a
man, an’ flung his bones inter the quicklime in
my rock-house.”</p>

<p>Haines, with a galvanic start, turned, pale and
aghast, upon his companion. He could only gasp,
but Knowles went on convulsively and without
question: “I s’picioned him from the fust. He
stopped thar at the cave whar I war burnin’ lime
the night o’ the show, an’ holped ter put it in
outer the weather bein’ ez the rain would slake
it. An’ he axed me ef quicklime would sure burn
up a dead body. An’ when I told him, he turned
as he went away an’ looked back, smilin’ an’ sorter
motionin’ with his hand, an’ looked back agin, an’
looked back.”</p>

<p>He reached out slowly for the stick with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
bundle tied at the end, and dragged it toward him,
the breath of the scalding lime perceptible as it
was drawn near.</p>

<p>“Las’ week, one evenin’ late,” he said in a
lowered voice and with his eyes alight and glancing,
“hevin’ kep’ a watch on this young buzzard,
an’ noticin’ him forever travelin’ the New Helveshy
road what ain’t no business o’ his’n, I
’lowed I’d foller him. An’ he kerries a bundle.
He walks fast an’ stops short, an’ studies, an’
turns back suddint, an’ stops agin, an’ whirls
roun’, an’ goes on. An’ his face looks like death!
An’ sometimes he stops short to sigh, ez ef he
couldn’t get his breath. But he don’t go ter New
Helveshy. He goes ter my cave. An’ he hev got
breath enough ter fling away that tormented big
boulder, an’ toss in these gyarmints, an’ churn the
lime over ’em with a stick till he hed ter hold his
hand over his eyes ter keep his eyesight, an’ fling
back the boulder, an’ run off faster ’n a fox along
the road ter Sims’s.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence as the two men looked
into each other’s eyes.</p>

<p>“What air ye tellin’ this ter me fur?” said
Haines at last, struggling with a mad impulse of
hope—of joy, was it? For if this were true,—and
true it must be,—the spurious supplantation
in Euphemia’s affections might soon be at an end.
If her love could not endure ridicule, would it
condone crime? All might yet be well; justice
tardily done, the law upheld; the intruder removed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
from the sphere where he had occasioned such
woe, and the old sweet days of love’s young dream
to be lived anew.</p>

<p>“Fur the Marster’s sarvice,” said the wily hypocrite.
“I sez ter myself, ‘Owen Haines won’t see
the right tromped on. He won’t see the ongodly
flourish. He won’t see the wolf a-lopin’ through
the fold. He won’t hear in the night the blood o’
Abel cryin’ from the groun’ agin the guilty Cain,
an’ not tell the sher’ff what air no furder off, jes’
now, ’n ‘Possum Cross-Roads.’”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you-uns let him know yerse’f?”
demanded Haines shortly.</p>

<p>“Waal, I be a-settin’ up nights with my sick
nephews: three o’ them chil’n down with the
measles, an’ my sister an’ brother-in-law bein’ so
slack-twisted I be ’feared they’d gin ’em the
wrong med’cine ef I warn’t thar ter gin d’rections.”
His eye brightened as he noted Haines
reaching forward for the end of the stick and
slowly drawing the bundle toward him.</p>

<p>It is admitted that a leopard cannot change his
spots, and, without fear of successful contradiction,
one may venture to add to the illustrations of
immutability that a coward cannot change his temperament.
Now the fact that Peter Knowles was
a coward had been evinced by his conduct on
several occasions within the observation of his compatriots.
His craft, however, had served to adduce
mitigating circumstances, and so consigned the matter
to oblivion that it did not once occur to Haines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
that it was fear which had evolved the subterfuge
of enlisting his well-known enthusiasm for religion
and right, and his natural antagonism against the
juggler, in the Master’s service. On the one hand,
Knowles dreaded being called to account for whatever
else might be found unconsumed by the lime
in the grotto, did he disclose naught of his discovery.
On the other hand, the character of informer
is very unpopular in the mountains, owing
to the revelations of moonshining often elicited by
the rewards offered for the detection of the infringement
of the revenue laws. Persons of this class
indeed sometimes receive a recompense in another
metal, which, if not so satisfactory as current coin,
is more conclusive and lasting. It was the recollection
of leaden tribute of this sort, should the matter
prove explicable, or the man escape, or the
countryside resent the appeal to the law, which
induced Peter Knowles to desire to shift upon
Haines the active responsibility of giving information:
his jealousy in love might be considered a
motive adequate to bring upon him all the retributions
of the recoil of the scheme if aimed amiss.</p>

<p>Knowles watched the young man narrowly and
with a glittering eye as, with a trembling hand and
a look averse, Haines began to untie the cord which
held the package together.</p>

<p>“He killed the man, Owen, ez sure ez ye air
livin’, an’ flunged his bones in the quicklime, an’
now he flunged in his clothes,” Knowles was saying
as the bundle gave loose in the handling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>Drawing back with a sense of suffocation as a
cloud of minute particles of quicklime rose from
the folds of the material, Owen Haines nevertheless
recognized upon the instant the garments
which the juggler himself had worn when he first
came to the Cove, the unaccustomed fashion of
which had riveted the young mountaineer’s attention
for the time at the “show” at the church-house.</p>

<p>With a certain complex duality of emotion, he
experienced a sense of dismay to note how his
heart sank with the extinguishment of his hope
that the man might prove a criminal and that this
discovery might rid the country of him. How ill
he had wished him! Not only that the fierce blast
of the law might consume him, but, reaching back
into the past, that he might have wrought evil
enough to justify it and make the retribution sure!
With a pang as of sustaining loss he gasped,
“Why, these hyar gyarmints air his own wear.
I hev viewed him in ’em many a time whenst he
fust kem ter the Cove!”</p>

<p>Knowles glared at him in startled doubt, and
slowly turned over one of the pointed russet shoes.
“He hed ’em on the night he gin the show in the
Cove,” said Haines.</p>

<p>“I seen him that night,” said Knowles conclusively.
“He hed on no sech cur’ous clothes ez
them, else I’d hev remarked ’em, sure!”</p>

<p>“Ye ’lowed ’twar night an’ by the flicker o’
the fire, an’ ye war in a cornsider’ble o’ a jigget
’bout’n yer lime.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>“Naw, sir! naw, sir! he hed on no sech coat ez
that, ennyhow,” protested Knowles. Then, with
rising anger, “Ye air a pore shoat fur sense, Owen
Haines! Ef they air his gyarmints, what’s the
reason he hid ’em so secret an’ whar the quicklime
would deestroy ’em; bein’ so partic’lar ter ax o’
me ef ’twould burn boots an’ clothes an’ bone,—<i>bone</i>,
too?”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” said Haines, at a loss, and turning
the black-and-red blazer vaguely in his hands.</p>

<p>“I do; them folks over ter New Helveshy wears
sech fool gear ez these,” Knowles insisted, from
his superior knowledge, for in the interest of his
lime-trade he had visited New Helvetia more than
once,—a rare trip for a denizen of Etowah Cove.</p>

<p>“Thar ain’t nobody missin’ at New Helveshy!”
Haines argued, against his lingering hope.</p>

<p>“How do you-uns know?” exclaimed Knowles
hurriedly, and with a certain alert alarm in his
face. “Somebody comin’ ez never got thar!
Somebody goin’ ez never got away!” He had
risen excitedly to his feet. What ghastly secret
might be hidden beneath the residue of quicklime
in that dark cavern, the responsibility possibly to
be laid at his door!</p>

<p>Owen Haines, looking up at him with childlike
eyes, was slowly studying his face,—a fierce face,
with the savagery of his cowardice as predatory an
element as the wantonness of his malice.</p>

<p>“These hyar air his clothes,” Haines reiterated;
“I ’members ’em well. This hyar split buttonhole
at the throat”—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>“That’s whar he clutched the murdered one,”
declared Knowles tumultuously.</p>

<p>—“an’ these water-marks on these hyar shoes,—they
hed been soaked,—an’ this hyar leather
belt, whar two p’ints hed been teched through
with a knife-blade, stiddier them round holes, ter
draw the belt up tighter ’n it war made ter be
wore,—I could swar ter ’em,—an’ this hyar”—</p>

<p>Knowles looked down at him in angry doubt.
“Shucks,” he interrupted, “ye besotted idjit! I
dunno what ailed me ter kem ter you-uns. I
’lowed ye war so beset ter do—yer—Marster’s—work!”
with a mocking whine. “But ye ain’t.
Ye seek yer own chance! The Lord tied yer
tongue with a purpose, an’ he wasted no brains
on a critter ez he didn’t ’low ter hev gabblin’
round the throne. Ye see ter it ye say nuthin’
bout’n this, else jestice’ll take arter you-uns, too,
an’ ye won’t be much abler ter talk ter the court
o’ law ’n the court o’ the Lawd.” He wagged his
head vehemently at the young man, while kneeling
to make up anew the bundle of garments, until
the scorching vapor compelled him to turn aside.
When he arose, he stood erect for one doubtful
instant. Then, satisfied by the reflection that for
the sake of his own antagonism toward the juggler
the jealous and discarded lover would do naught
to frustrate the vengeance that menaced Royce, he
turned suddenly, and, with the bundle swaying as
before on the end of the stick, started without a
word along the path by which he had come, leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
Owen Haines gazing after him till he disappeared
amongst the leaves.</p>

<p>How long Haines sat there staring at the vanishing
point of that bosky perspective he could hardly
have said. When he leaped to his feet, it was
with a repentant sense of the waste of time and
the need of haste. His long, lank, slouching figure
seemed incompatible with any but the most
languid rate of progression; and indeed it was not
his habit to get over the ground at the pace which
he now set for himself. This was hardly slackened
through the several miles he traversed until
he reached the schoolhouse, which he found silent
and empty. After a wild-eyed and hurried survey,
he set forth anew, tired, breathless, his shoulders
bent, his head thrust forward, his gait unequal;
for he was not of the stalwart physique
common amongst the youth of the Cove. He
reached the Sims cabin, panting, anxious-eyed,
and hardly remembering his grievances against
Phemie when he saw her in the passage. She
looked at him askance over her shoulder as she
rose in silent disdain to go indoors.</p>

<p>“I ain’t kem hyar ter plague you-uns, Phemie,”
he called out, divining her interpretation of his
motive. “I want ter speak ter that thar juggler-man,”—
he could not bring himself to mention
the name.</p>

<p>She paused a moment, and he perceived in surprise
that her proud and scornful face bore no
tokens of happiness. Her lips had learned a pathetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
droop; her eyelids were heavy, and the long
lashes lifted barely to the level of her glance.
The words in a low voice, “He ain’t hyar,” were
as if wrung from her by the necessity of the moment,
so unwilling they seemed, and she entered
the house as Mrs. Sims flustered out of the opposite
door.</p>

<p>“Laws-a-massy, Owen Haines,” she exclaimed,
“ye better lef’ be that thar juggler-man, ez ye
calls him! He could throw you-uns over his shoulder.
Ye’ll git inter trouble, meddlin’. Phemie
be plumb delighted with her ch’ice, an’ a gal hev
got a right ter make a ch’ice wunst in her life,
ennyhows.”</p>

<p>He sought now and again to stem the tide of
her words, but only when a breathless wheeze
silenced her he found opportunity to protest that
he meant no harm to the juggler, and he held no
grudge against Euphemia; that he was the bearer
of intelligence important to the juggler, and she
would do her guest a favor to disclose his whereabouts.</p>

<p>There were several added creases—they could
hardly be called wrinkles—in Mrs. Sims’s face of
late, and a certain fine network of lines had been
drawn about her eyes. She was anxious, troubled,
irritated, all at once, and entertained her own
views touching the admission of the fact of the
juggler’s frequent and lengthened absence from
his beloved. Euphemia’s fascinations for him
were evidently on the wane, and although he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
gentle and considerate and almost humble when
he was at the house, he seemed listless and melancholy,
and had grown silent and unobservant, and
they had all marked the change.</p>

<p>“We-uns kin hardly git shet o’ the boy,” said
Mrs. Sims easily, lying in an able-bodied fashion.
“But I do b’lieve ter-day ez he hev tuk heart o’
grace an’ gone a-huntin’.”</p>

<p>Owen Haines’s countenance fell. Of what avail
to follow at haphazard in the vastness of the mountain
wilderness? There was naught for him to do
but return to his work, and wait till nightfall
might bring home the man he sought. Meantime,
the sheriff was as near as ’Possum Cross-Roads,
only twelve miles down the valley. Peter Knowles
would probably give the information which he had
tried to depute to the supplanted lover. Haines
did not doubt now the juggler’s innocence, but
he appreciated the cruel ingenuity of perverse circumstances,
and he had felt the venom of malice.
Thus it was that he had sought to warn the man of
the discovery which Peter Knowles had made, and
of the very serious construction he was disposed to
place upon the facts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> this crisis supervened, Lucien Royce
was at New Helvetia Springs, at the bowling-alley.
His resolution that the beautiful girl, whom he
had learned to adore at a distance, should never
see him again in a guise so unworthy of him, of
his true position in life, and of his antecedents,
collapsed one day in an incident which was a
satiric comment upon its importance. He met her
unexpectedly in the mountain woods, within a
few miles of the Cove, one of a joyous young
equestrian party, and riding like the wind. The
plainness of the black habit, the hat, the high close
white collar, seemed to embellish her beauty, in
that no adornments frivolously diverted the attention
from the perfection of its detail. The flush
on her cheek, the light in her eye, the lissome
grace of her slender figure, all attested a breezy
delight in the swift motion; her smile shone down
upon him like the sudden revelation of a star in
the midst of a closing cloud, when he sprang forward
and handed her the whip which she had
dropped at the moment of passing, before the
cavalier at her side could dismount to recover it.
A polite inclination of the head, a murmur of
thanks, a broadside of those absolutely unrecognizing
eyes, and she was gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>She evidently had no remembrance of him.
His alert intuition could have detected it in her
face if she had. For her he had no existence.
He thought, as he walked on into the silence and
the wilderness, of his resolution and his self-denial,
and he laughed bitterly at the futility of the one
and the pangs of the other. He need never wince
to be so lowly placed, so mean, so humble, for she
never thought of him. He need not fear to go
near her, to haunt, like the ghost he was, her
ways in life, for she would never look at him, she
would never realize that he was near; for most
people are thus insensible of spectral influences.</p>

<p>When he sat for the first time on a bench
against the wall, by the door of the bowling-alley,
with two or three mountaineers whose lethargic
curiosity—their venison or peaches having been
sold—was excited in a degree by the spectacle of
the game of tenpins, he had much ado to control
the agitation that beset him, the pangs of humiliation.
But after this day he came often, availing
himself of the special courtesy observed by
the players in providing a bench for the mountaineers,
as spectators, who were indeed never
intrusive or out of place, and generally of most
listless and uninterested attitude toward the freaks
and frivolities of New Helvetia. This attention
seemed a gracious and kindly condescension, and
flattered a conscious sentiment of <i>noblesse oblige</i>.
There were other spectators, of better quality, on
the opposite side of the long low building,—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
elders among the sojourners at New Helvetia
Springs,—while down the centre, between the
two alleys, were the benches on which the players
were ranged.</p>

<p>She was sometimes among these, always graceful
and girlish, with a look of innocence in her
eyes like some sweet child’s, and wearing her youth
and beauty like a crown, with that unique touch
of dignity suggestive of a splendid future development,
and that these days, lovely though they
might be, were not destined to be her best. One
might have pitied the hot envy he felt toward the
youths who handed her the balls and applauded
her play, and hung about near her, and chatted in
the intervals,—so foolish, so hopeless, so bitter
it was. Sometimes he heard her responses: little
of note, the talk of a girl of his day and world,
but animated with a sort of individuality, a something
like herself,—or did he fancy it was like no
one else? He had met his fate too late; this was
the one woman in all the world for him. She
could have made of him anything she would. His
heart stirred with a vague impulse of reminiscent
ambitions that might have been facts had she come
earlier. He loved her, and he felt that never before
had he loved. The slight spurious evanescent
emotion, evoked from idleness or folly or caprice,
in sundry remembered episodes of his old world,
or evolved in the desert of his loneliness for Euphemia,—how
vain, how unreal, how ephemeral,
how unjustified! But she who would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
the supreme power in his life had come at last—and
had come too late. How truly he reasoned he
knew well, as he sat in his humble garb amongst
his uncouth associates on the segregated bench,
and heard the thunder of the balls and the swift
steps of the lightly passing figures at the head of
the alley; but surely he should not have been capable
of an added pang when he discerned, with a
sense almost as impersonal as if he were indeed
the immaterial essence he claimed to be, her fate
in the identity of a lately arrived guest. This was
a man of middle height and slender, about thirty-five
years of age, with a slight bald spot on the
top of his well-shaped head. He had a keen narrow
face, an inexpressive calm manner, and was
evidently a personage of weight in the world of
men, sustaining a high social and financial consideration.
He did not take part in the game. He
leaned against a pillar near her, and bent over
her, and talked to her in the intervals of her
play. He had apparently little affinity for youthful
amusements, and spent much of his time with
her parents. His mission here was most undisguised,
and it seemed to the poor juggler that
the fortunate suitor was but a personified conventionality,
whom no woman could truly love, and
who could truly love no woman.</p>

<p>When once Royce had acquired the sense of
invisibility, he put no curb on his poor and humble
cravings to see her, to hear the sound of her voice
albeit she spoke only to others. Every day found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
him on the mountaineers’ bench at the bowling-alley,
sometimes alone, sometimes in grotesque
company, the ridicule, he knew, of the young and
thoughtless; and he had no care if he were ridiculed
too. Sometimes she came, and he was
drearily happy. Frequently she was absent, and
in dull despair he sat and dreamed of her till the
game was done. He grew to love the inanimate
things she touched, the dress she wore; he even
loved best that which she wore most often, and his
heart lightened whenever he recognized it, as if the
sight of it were some boon of fate, and their common
preference for it a bond of sympathy. Once
she came in late from a walk in the woods, wearing
white, with a purple cluster of the wild verbena at
her bosom. There was a blossom lying upon the
floor after the people were all gone. He saw it as
it slipped down, and he waited, and then, in the
absolute solitude, with a furtive gesture he picked
it up, and after that he always wore it, folded in
a bit of paper, over his heart.</p>

<p>In the midst of this absorbing emotion Lucien
Royce did not feel the pangs of supplantation till
the fact had been repeatedly driven home. When,
returning from New Helvetia, he would find Jack
Ormsby sitting on the steps of the cabin porch,
talking to Euphemia, he welcomed as a relief the
opportunity to betake himself and his bitter brooding
thoughts down to the bank of the river, where
he was wont to walk to and fro under the white
stars, heedless of the joyous voices floating down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
to him, deaf to all save the inflections of a voice
in his memory. He began gradually to note with
a dull surprise Euphemia’s scant, overlooking
glance when her eyes must needs turn toward him;
her indifferent manner,—even averse, it might
seem; her disaffected languor save when Jack
Ormsby’s shadow fell athwart the door. In some
sort Royce had grown obtuse to all except the sentiment
that enthralled him. Under normal circumstances
he would have detected instantly the
flimsy pretense with which she sought to stimulate
his jealousy, to restore his allegiance, to sustain
her pride. She had not dreamed that her hold
upon his heart, gained only by reason of his loneliness
and despair and the distastefulness of his
surroundings, had slackened the instant a deep
and real love took possession of him. She had
not divined this hopeless, silent love—from afar,
from infinite lengths of despair!—for another.
She only knew that somehow he had grown oblivious
of her, and was much absent from her. This
touched her pride, her fatal pride! And thus she
played off Jack Ormsby against him as best she
might, and held her head very high.</p>

<p>The sense of desertion inflicted upon him only
a dull pain. He said listlessly to himself, his
pride untouched, that she had not really loved
him, that she had been merely fascinated for a
time by the novelty of the “readin’s,” and now
she cared for them and him no more. He recalled
the readiness with which she had forsworn her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
earlier lover, when his conscience had conflicted
with her pride, and this seeming fickleness was
accented anew in the later change. Royce tacitly
acquiesced in it, no longer struggling as he had
done at first with a sense of loyalty to her, but
giving himself up to his hopeless dream, precious
even in its conscious futility.</p>

<p>How long this quiescent state might have proved
more pleasure than pain it is hard to say. There
suddenly came into its melancholy serenities a wild
tumult of uncertainty, a mad project, a patent
possibility that set his brain on fire and his heart
plunging. He argued within himself—with some
doubting, denying, forbidding instinct of self-immolation,
as it seemed, that had somehow attained
full control of him in these days—that in
one sense he was fully the equal of Miss Fordyce,
as well born, as well bred, as she, as carefully
trained in all the essentials that regulate polite
society. She would sustain no derogation if he
could contrive an entrance to her social circle, and
meet her there as an equal. He had overheard in
the fragmentary gossip mention of people in New
Orleans, familiars of her circle, to whom he was
well known. He did not doubt that his father’s
name and standing would be instantly recognized
by her father, Judge Archibald Fordyce,—the
sojourners at New Helvetia were identifiable to
him now,—or indeed by any man of consequence
of that gentleman’s acquaintance. Under normal
circumstances the formality of an introduction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
would be a matter of course. If she had chanced
to spend a winter in St. Louis, Royce would doubtless
have danced with her on a dozen different
occasions; he wondered blankly if he would then
have adequately valued the privilege! He felt now
that he would give his life for a touch of her hand,
a look of her eyes fixed upon him observingly;
how the utter neutrality of her glance hurt him!
He would give his soul for the bliss of one waltz.
He trembled as he realized how possible, how
easily and obviously practicable, this had become.</p>

<p>For the tableaux and fancy-dress ball had been
so relished by the more juvenile element of New
Helvetia that the successor of that festivity was
already projected. This was to be a grotesquerie
in calico costumes and masks, chiefly of facetious
characters. The masks were deemed essential by
the small designers of the entertainment, since the
secret of the various disguises had not been carefully
kept, and these vizards were ingenuously
relied on to protect the incognito of certain personages
garbed, with the aid of sympathetic elders,
as Dolly Varden, Tilly Slowboy (with a rag-doll
baby furnished with a head proof against banging
on door-frames or elbows), Sir John Falstaff, three
feet high, Robinson Crusoe, and similar celebrities.
The whole affair was esteemed a tedious superfluity
by the youths of twenty and a few years
upward, already a trifle blasé, who sometimes lingered
and talked and smoked in the bowling-alley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
after the game was finished and the ladies had
gone. It was from overhearing this chat that
Royce learned that although the majority of the
young fellows, tired with one effort of devising
costumes, had declined to go in calico and in
character, still, in deference to the style of the
entertainment and the importunity of the children
who had projected it, they had agreed to attend
in mask. Their out-of-door attire of knickerbockers
and flannel shirts and blazers ought to be
deemed, they thought, shabby enough to appease
the “tacky” requirements of the juvenile managers,
who were pleased to call their burlesque
masquerade a “tacky party.”</p>

<p>Then it was that Royce realized his opportunity.
The knickerbockers and flannel shirt, the red-and-black
blazer and russet shoes, in which he had
entered Etowah Cove, now stowed away in the
roof-room of Tubal Cain Sims’s house, were not
more the worse for wear than much of such attire
at New Helvetia Springs after a few weeks of
mountain rambles. Ten minutes in the barbershop
of the hotel, at a late hour when it would be
deserted by its ordinary patrons, would put him
in trim for the occasion, and doubtless its functionaries
who had never seen him would fancy him in
this dress a newly arrived guest of the hotel or of
some of the New Helvetia summer cottagers. He
had even a prevision of the free and casual gesture
with which he would hand an attendant a quarter
of a dollar and send across the road to the store<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
for a mask. And then—and then—he could feel
already the rhythm of the waltz music beating in
every pulse; he breathed even now the breeze
quickening in the motion of the dance, endowed
with the sweetness of the zephyrs of the seventh
heaven. It was she—she alone—whom he would
care to approach; the rest, they were as naught!
One touch of her hand, the rapture of one waltz,
and he would be ready to throw himself over the
bluff; for he would have attained the uttermost
happiness that earth could bestow upon him now.</p>

<p>And suddenly he was ready to throw himself
over the bluff that he should even have dreamed
this dream. For all that his pulses still beat to
the throb of that mute strain, that his eyes were
alight with an unrealized joy, that the half quiver,
half smile of a visionary expectation lingered at
his lips, the red rush of indignant humiliation
covered his face and tingled to the very tips of his
fingers. He was far on the road between the Cove
and the Springs, and he paused in the solitude
that he might analyze this thing, and see where
he stood and whither he was tending. He, of all
men in the world, an intruder, a partaker of pleasures
designed exclusively for others! He to wear
a mask where he might not dare to show his face!
He to scheme to secure from her,—from <i>her</i>!—through
false pretenses, under the mistake that he
was another, a notice, a word, chance phrases, the
touch of her confiding hand, the ecstasy of a waltz!
He had no words for himself!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>He was an exile and penniless. He had no
identity. He could reveal himself only to be
falsely suspected of a vile robbery in a position of
great trust; any lapse of caution would consign
him to years of unjust imprisonment in a felon’s
cell. He was the very sport of a cruel fate. He
had naught left of all the lavish earthly endowments
with which he had begun life save his own
estimate of his own sense of honor. But this was
still precious to him. Bereft as he was, he was
still a gentleman at heart. He claimed that,—he
demanded of himself his own recognition as such.
Never again, he determined, as he began to walk
slowly along the road once more, never again
should expert sophistries tempt him. He would
not argue his equality with her, his birth, his education,
the social position of his people. It was
enough to reflect that if she knew all she would
shrink from him. He would not again seek refuge
in the impossibility that his identity could be discovered
as a guest at the ball. He would not
plead as a set-off against the deception how innocent
its intention, how transient, how venial a
thing it was. And lest in his loneliness,—for
since the atmosphere of his old world had once
more inflated his lungs he was as isolated in the
Sims household, he found its air as hard to breathe,
as if he were in an exhausted receiver,—in his
despair, in the hardship of his lot, in the deep
misery of the first true, earnest, and utterly hopeless
love of his life, some fever of wild enterprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
should rise like a delirium in his brain, and confuse
his sense of right and wrong, and palsy his
capacity for resistance, and counsel disguise, and
destroy his reverent appreciation of what was due
to her, he would put it beyond his power ever to
masquerade in the likeness of his own self and the
status of his own true position in the world; he
would render it necessary that he should always
appear before her in the absolutely false and contemptible
rôle of a country boor, an uncouth, unlettered
clown.</p>

<p>At the paradox of this conclusion he burst into
a grim laugh; then—for he would no longer meddle
with these subtle distinctions of right and
wrong, where, in the metamorphoses of deduction,
the false became true, and interchangeably the
true was false—he began to run, and in the strong
vivacity of his pride in his physical prowess he
was able to reflect that better time was seldom
made by an amateur, unless for a short spurt,
than the pace he kept all the way to the Sims
cabin. He would not let himself think while in
the roof-room he rolled the jaunty suit into a bundle.
He set his teeth and breathed hard as he
recognized a certain pleasure which his finger-tips
derived from the very touch of the soft, fine texture
of the cloth, and realized how tenuous was
the quality of his resolution, how quick he must
needs be to carry into effect the conclusions of his
sober judgment, lest he waver anew. He was out
again and a mile away before he began to debate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
the disposition which it would be best to make of
the bundle under his arm. He recalled with a
momentary regret Mrs. Sims’s kitchen fire, over
which doubtless Euphemia was now bending, busy
with the johnny-cake for the evening meal. He
dismissed the thought on the instant. The feminine
ideas of economy would never suffer the destruction
of so much good all-wool gear, whatever
its rescue might cost in the future. Moreover, it
would be inexplicable. He could get a spade and
bury the bundle,—and dig it up, too, the next
time this mad, unworthy temptation should assail
him. He could throw it into the river,—and fish
it out again.</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered the lime-kiln. The
greater portion of its product had been used long
ago, but the residue still lay unslaked in the dry
cavern, and more than once, in passing, he had
noted the great boulder rolled to the aperture
and securely closing it against the entrance of air
and moisture. The place was in the immediate
vicinity, and somehow, although he had been here
often since, the predominant impression in his
mind, when he reached the jutting promontory of
rock and gazed down at the sea of foliage in the
Cove, that surely had once known the ebb and flow
of tides other than the spring bourgeonings and
the autumn desiccations, was the reminiscence of
that early time in Etowah Cove when he had stood
here in the white glare from the lime-kiln and
watched that strange anamorphosis of the lime-burner’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
face through the shimmering medium of
the uprising heat. He seemed to see it again,—all
unaware that now, in its normal proportions,
that face looked down upon him from the height
of the cliff above, although its fright, its surprise,
its crafty intimations, its malevolence, distorted
it hardly less than the strange effects of
the writhing currents of heat and air in that dark
night so long ago.</p>

<p>The young man hesitated once more. He had
a certain conscientious reverence for property and
order; it was with a distinct wrench of volition
that he would destroy aught of even small value.
But as he seated himself on the ledge, shaking out
the natty black-and-red blazer, he recognized the
melody that was mechanically murmuring through
his lips,—again, still again, the measures of a
waltz, that waltz through whose enchanted rhythms
he had fancied that he and she might dreamily drift
together. He sprang to his feet in a panic. With
one mighty effort he flung the great boulder aside.
Hastily he dropped the garments with the shoes,
belt, and long blue hose, into the cavern, and with
a staff stirred the depths of the lime till it rose
above them. More than once he was fain to step
back from the scorching air and the smarting white
powder that came in puffs from the interior.</p>

<p>“That’s enough,” he muttered mockingly after
a moment, as he stood with his muscles relaxed,
sick with the sentiment of the renunciation of the
world which the demolition of the sophisticated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
garb included in its significance. “I cannot undertake
to dance with any fine lady in this toggery
now; she’d think I had come straight from
hell. And,” with a swift change of countenance,
“so I have!—so I have!”</p>

<p>Then, with his habitual carefulness where any
commercial interest, however small, was concerned,
he roused himself, wrenched the great boulder
back into its place, noting here and there a crevice,
and filling it with smaller stones and earth
that no air might gain admission; and, with one
final close scrutiny of the entrance, he took his way
into the dense laurel and the gathering dusk, all
unaware of the peering, suspicious, frightened face
and angry eyes that watched him from the summit
of the cliff above.</p>

<p>The discipline of life had certain subduing effects
on Lucien Royce. He felt very much tamed when
next he took a seat upon the bench placed aside in
the corner of the bowling-alley, to affect to watch
the game, but in truth to give his humble despair
what added pain it might deem pleasure and clutch
as solace, by the sight of her smiles won by happier
men, the sound of her voice, the meagre realities
of the day to supplement the lavish and fantastic
visions of his dreams. He had reached the
point where expectation fails. He looked only for
the eventless routine of the alley,—the hour of
amusement for the others, the lingering separation,
the silence of the deserted building, and the living
on the recollection of a glance of the eye, a turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
of the head, a displaced tendril of hair, softly
curling, until to-morrow, or the next day, or the
next, should give him the precious privilege of
making such observations for the sustenance of his
soul through another interval of absence. Suddenly,
his heart, dully beating on through these
dreary days, began to throb wildly, and he gazed
with quickening interest at the scene before him:
the long narrow shell of a building with the frequent
windows where the green leaves looked in,
the brown unplastered walls, the dark rafters rising
into the shadowy roof, and the crossing of the
great beams into which records of phenomenal
successions of ten strikes had been cut by the
vaunting winners of matches, with their names
and the dates of the event, the year of the Lord
methodically affixed, as if these deeds were such
as were to be cherished by posterity. Down the
smooth and shining alley a ball was rolling. Miss
Gertrude Fordyce, wearing a sheer green-and-white
dress of simple lawn and a broad hat trimmed
with ferns, was standing at the head of the alley,
about to receive her second ball from the hands of
a blond young cavalier in white flannels. Royce
had seen him often since the morning when he had
observed him giving his valuable advice as to the
erection of the stage in the ballroom, and knew
that he was Millden Seymour, just admitted to the
bar, with a reputation for talent, an intelligent
face, and a smooth and polished <i>bonhomie</i> of manner;
he was given to witty sayings, and was a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
too intent upon the one he was exploiting at this
moment to notice that the pins at the further end
of the alley had not been set up, the hotel functionary
detailed for that duty not having arrived.
Miss Fordyce hesitated, with the ball in her hand,
in momentary embarrassment, the color in her
cheeks and a laugh in her eyes.</p>

<p>Royce sprang up, and running lightly down by
the side of the alley placed the pins in readiness
to receive her second ball; then stood soberly
aside, his hat in his hand, as if to watch the execution
of the missile.</p>

<p>“How very polite!” said one of the chaperons
over her knitting to another. “I often notice
that young man. He seems to take so much interest
in the game.”</p>

<p>This trifling dévoir, however, which Royce had
not hesitated to offer to a lady, savored of servility
in its appropriation by a man. Nevertheless, he
was far too discreet, too well aware of what was
due to Miss Fordyce, to allow the attention to seem
a personal tribute from him. He silently cursed
his officiousness, notwithstanding, as he bent down
to set the tenpins in place for the second player,
who happened to be the smart young cavalier.
Only with an effort Royce conserved his blithe air
and a certain amiable alacrity as through a round
or two of the game he continued to set up the pins;
but when the flustered and hurried bell-boy whose
duty he had performed came panting in, Royce
could have broken the recreant’s head with right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
good will, and would not restrain a tendency to
relapse into his old gait and pose, which had no
savor of meekness, as he sauntered up the side of
the alley to his former seat beside the mountaineers,
who had gazed stolidly at his performance.</p>

<p>Royce noted that one or two of the more athletic
of the young men had followed his movements with
attention. “Confound you!” he said to himself
irritably. “I am man enough to throw you over
that beam, and you are hardly so stupid as to fail
to know it.”</p>

<p>Miss Fordyce had not turned her eyes toward
him,—no more, he said to himself, than if he had
been the side of the wall. And notwithstanding
the insignia of civilization thrust out of sight into
the quicklime and the significance of their destruction,
and the flagellant anguish of the discipline
of hopelessness and humiliation, he felt this as a
burning injustice and grief, and the next instant
asked himself in disdain what could such a man
gain if she should look at him in his lowly and
humble estate?</p>

<p>Royce brooded gloomily upon these ideas during
the rest of the game; and when the crowd had
departed, and he had risen to take leave of the
scene that he lived by, he noticed, with only the
sense that his way was blocked, several of the
young men lingering about the door. They had
been glancing at him, and as one of them,—it
was Seymour,—in a very propitiatory manner,
approached him, he became suddenly aware that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
they had been discussing the appropriateness of
offering him a gratuity for setting up the tenpins
in the heat and dust while they played. Seymour
was holding out their joint contributions in his
hand; but his affability was petrified upon his
countenance as his mild eyes caught the fiery
glance which Royce flung at the group, and marked
the furious flush which suffused neck and face and
ears as he realized their intention. It was a moment
of mutual embarrassment. They meant no
offense, and he knew it. Had he been what he
seemed, it would have been shabby in the last
degree to accept such timely offices with no tender
of remuneration. Royce’s ready tact served to
slacken the tension.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said abruptly, but despite his easy
manner his voice trembled, “let me show you
something.”</p>

<p>He took a silver quarter of a dollar from the
handful of small change still mechanically extended,
and, turning to a table which held a tray
with glasses, he played the trick with the goblet
and the bit of money that had interested the
captain of the ill-fated steamboat on the night
when Lucien Royce perished so miserably to the
world. It was with a good-natured feigning of
interest that the young men pressed round, at first,
all willing to aid the salving of the honest pride
which their offering had evidently so lacerated.
But this gave way to an excitement that had rarely
been paralleled at New Helvetia Springs, as feat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
succeeded feat. The juggler was soon eager to
get away, having served his purpose of eluding
their bounty, but this was more difficult than he
had anticipated. He feared troublesome questions,
but beyond a “Say, how in thunder did you learn
all this?” there were none; and the laconic response,
“From a traveling fellow,” seemed to allay
their curiosity.</p>

<p>After a little he forgot their ill-starred benevolence;
his spirits expanded in this youthful society,
the tone of which was native to him, and from
which he had long been an outcast. He began to
reflect subacutely that the idea of a fugitive from
justice would not occur to men of their social position
so readily as to the mountaineers, who were
of a more restricted field of speculation and limited
knowledge of the world. He might seem to these
summer sojourners, perhaps, a man educated beyond
his prospects in life and his station, and
ashamed of both; such types are not altogether
unknown. Or perhaps he might be rusticating
in this humble fashion, being a person of small
means, or a man with some malady, attracted here
like others in search of health, but of a lower
grade of society. “For they tell me,” he said
satirically to himself, “that such people have lungs
and livers like the best of us!” He might be a
native touched by some unhallowed ambition, and,
having tried his luck in the outer world, flung
back upon his despised beginnings and out of a
job. He might be the schoolmaster in the Cove,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
of a vastly higher grade than the native product,
doubtless, but these young fellows were uninterested
and unobservant, and hardly likely to evolve
accurate distinctions. He felt sure that the idea
of crime would occur to these gay butterflies the
most remotely of all the possible solutions of the
anomalies of his presence and his garb. He began
to give himself up unconsciously to the mild pleasure
of their association; their chatter, incongruously
enough, revived his energies and solaced
his feelings like some suave balm. But he experienced
a quick repulsion and a start of secret terror
when two or three, having consulted apart for a
few moments, joined the group again, and called
upon him to admire their “cheek,” as they phrased
it, in the proposition they were about to make,—no
less than that he should consent to perform
some of his wonderful feats of sleight of hand at
an entertainment which they proposed to give
at New Helvetia. They explained to him, as if
he had not grievous cause to know already, that
the young ladies had devised a series of tableaux
followed by a ball; that the children had scored
a stunning success in a “tacky party;” that the
married people had preëmpted the not very original
idea of a <i>fête champêtre</i>, and to preclude any
unmannerly jumping of their claim had fixed the
date, wind and weather permitting, and had formally
bidden the guests, all the summer birds at
New Helvetia Springs. And now it devolved
upon the young men to do their part toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
whiling away time for the general pleasure,—a
task for which, oddly enough, they were not so
well equipped as one might imagine. They were
going to give a dramatic entertainment upon the
stage which had been erected for the tableaux in the
ballroom, and which still stood, it being cheaper,
the proprietor had remarked, to leave it there than
to erect it anew; for no one could be sure when
the young people would want it again. There
would be college songs first, glees and so forth,
and they made much of the prestige of a banjo-player
in their ranks. Some acrobatic feats by
the more athletic youths were contemplated, but
much uneasiness was felt because a budding littérateur—this
was again Mr. Seymour—was giving
token of a total breakdown in a farce he was writing
for the occasion, entitled “The New Woman,”
which, although beginning with aplomb and brilliancy,
showed no signs of reaching a conclusion,—a
flattering tribute to the permanence of the
subject. Mr. Seymour might not have it completed
by the date fixed. The skill of this amateur
prestidigitator would serve to fill the breach if the
playwright should not be ready; and even if inspiration
should smile upon him and bring him in
at the finish, the jugglery would enliven the long
waits while the scenes were being prepared and
the costumes changed.</p>

<p>Royce, with a sudden accession of prudence,
refused plumply; a sentiment of recoil possessed
him. He felt the pressure of the surprise and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
uncertainty like a positive pain as he sat perched
on the high window-sill, and gazed out into the
blank unresponsiveness of the undergrowth of the
forest, wilting in the heat of a hazy noon. The
young men forbore to urge him; that delicate
point of offering money, obviously so very nettling
to his pride, which seemed altogether a superfluous
luxury for a man in his position, hampered them.
He might, however, be in the habit of giving exhibitions
for pay; for aught they knew, the discussion
of the honorarium was in order. But they
had been schooled by the incident of the morning;
even the quarter of a dollar which had lent itself
to the nimble gyrations of legerdemain had found
its way by some unimagined art of jugglery into
the pocket of its owner, and Millden Seymour,
who had a bland proclivity to smooth rough places
and enjoy a refined peace of mind, was swearing
by all his gods that it should stay there until more
appropriately elicited.</p>

<p>An odd thing it was, Royce was feeling, that
without a moment’s hesitation he should accept
the box receipts of the “show” in the Cove, on
which he had subsisted for weeks, and yet in his
uttermost necessity he could not have brooked appearing
as a juggler before the sojourners at New
Helvetia Springs for his own benefit. The one
audience represented the general public, he supposed,
and was far from him. The other he felt as
his own status, his set; and he could as soon have
handed around the hat, after one of the snug little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
bachelor dinners he used to be so fond of giving
in St. Louis, as ask remuneration for his assistance
in this amateur entertainment of the young
butterflies at New Helvetia.</p>

<p>He burst into abrupt and sardonic laughter as
he divined their line of cogitation, and realized
how little they could imagine the incongruities of
his responsive mental processes. In the quick
change from a pondering gravity to this repellent
gayety there was something of the atmosphere of
a rude rebuff, and a certain dignity and distance
informed the manner of the few who still lounged
about with their cigars. Royce hastened to nullify
this. They had shown much courtesy to one of
his low degree, and although he knew—from experience,
poor fellow—that it was prompted not
so much by a perception of his deserts as by a
realization of their own, it being the conduct and
sentiment which graced them and which they owed
to persons of their condition, he had no wish to be
rude, even though it might seem that he owed a
man in <i>his</i> position nothing.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll help you,” he said hastily, “though
we shall have to rig up some sort of properties.
But I don’t need much.”</p>

<p>The talk fell upon these immediately, and he
forthwith perceived that he was in for it. And
why not? he asked himself. How did it endanger
him, or why should he shun it? All the Cove and
the countryside for twenty miles around knew of
his feats of sleight of hand; and since accident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
had revealed his knack to this little coterie of well-bred
and well-placed young men, why should he
grudge the exhibition to the few scores of ladies
and children at New Helvetia, to aid the little
diversion of the evening? His scruples could have
no force now, for this would bring him—the
social pariah!—no nearer to them than when he
sat by the tenpin-alley and humbly watched his
betters play. The episode of the jugglery, once
past, would be an old story and bereft of interest.
He would have had his little day, basking in the
sun of the applause of his superiors, and would
sink back to his humble obscurity at the side of
the bowling-alley. Should he show any disposition
to presume upon the situation, he realized
that they well understood the art of repressing a
forward inferior. The entertainment contemplated
no subsequent social festivities. The programme,
made out with many an interlineation, had been
calculated to occupy all the time until eleven
o’clock; and Royce, looking at it with the accustomed
eye of a manager of private theatricals, felt
himself no prophet to discern that midnight would
find the exhausted audience still seated, enjoying
that royal good measure of amusement always
meted out by bounteous amateurs. Throughout
the evening he would be immured with the other
young men in the close little pens which served for
dressing and green rooms,—for all the actors in
the farce were to be men,—save for the fraction
of time when his jugglery would necessitate his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
presence on the stage. True, Miss Fordyce,
should she patronize the entertainment, might then
have to look at him somewhat more discerningly
than she would look at the wall, perhaps! It
could surely do her no harm. She had seen worse
men, he protested, with eager self-assertion. She
owed him that much,—one glance, one moment’s
cognition of his existence. It was not much to
ask. He had made a great sacrifice for her sake,
and all unknown to her. He had had regard to
her estimate of her dignity and held it dear. He
had done her reverence from the depths of his
heart, regardless that it cost him his last hope.</p>

<p>The powers of the air were gradually changing
at New Helvetia Springs. The light of the days
had grown dull and gray. Masses of white vapor
gathered in the valley, rising, and rising, and filling
all its depths and slopes, as if it were the
channel of some great river, till only the long
level line of the summit of the opposite range
showed above the impalpable tides in the similitude
of the further banks of a great stream. It
was a suggestive resemblance to Lucien Royce,
and he winced as he looked upon it. He was not
sorry when it had gone, for the gathering mists
soon pervaded the forests, and hid cliffs and
abysses and even the familiar path, save for the
step before the eye, and in this still whiteness all
the world was lost; at last one could only hear—for
it too shared the invisibilities—the rain falling
steadily, drearily, all the day and all the long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
long hours of the black night. The bowling-alley
was deserted; lawn-tennis had succumbed to the
weather; the horses stood in the stalls. One
might never know that the hotel at New Helvetia
Springs existed except that now and again, in
convolutions of mist as it rolled, a gable high up
might reveal itself for a moment, or a peaked turret;
unless indeed one were a ghost, to find some
spectral satisfaction in slipping viewless through
the white enveloping nullity, and gazing in at the
window of the great parlor, where a log fire was
ruddily aflare and the elders perused their newspapers
or worked their tidies, and the youth
swung in rocking-chairs and exchanged valuable
ideas, and played cards, and read a novel
aloud, and hung in groups about the tortured
piano. So close stood a poor ghost to the window
one day, risking observation, that he might have
read, over the charming outline of sloping shoulders
clad faultlessly in soft gray cloth, the page of
the novel which Miss Fordyce had brought there
to catch the light; so close that he might have
heard every syllable of the conversation which
ensued when the man in whom he discovered her
destiny—the cold, inexpressive-looking, personified
conventionality—came and sat beside her on
the sofa. But the poor ghost had more scruples
than reality of existence, and, still true to the sanctions
that control gentlemen in a world in which
he had no more part, he turned hastily away that
no syllable might reach him. And as he turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
he ran almost into the arms of a man who had
been tramping heavily up and down the veranda
in the white obscurities, all unaware of his propinquity.
It might have been better if he had!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> there were strangers at New Helvetia,—two
men who knew nobody and whom nobody
knew. Perhaps in all the history of the hotel this
instance was the first. The patronage of New
Helvetia, like that of many other secluded southern
watering-places, had been for generations
among the same clique of people, all more or less
allied by kindred or hereditary friendship, or close
association in their respective homes or in business
interests, and the traditions of the place were community
property. So significant was the event
that it could scarcely escape remark. More than
one of the hereditary sojourners observed to the
others that the distance of fifty miles from a railroad
over the worst stage-road in America seemed,
after all, no protection from the intrusion of
strangers. Here were two men who knew nobody,
whom nobody knew, and who seemed not even
to know each other. One was a quiet, decorous,
reserved person who might be easily overlooked
in a crowd, so null was his aspect. The other had
good, hearty, aggressive, rustic suggestions about
him. He was as stiffly upright as a ramrod, and
he marched about like a grenadier. He smoked
and chewed strong, rank tobacco. He flourished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
a red-bordered cotton handkerchief. He had been
carefully trimmed and shaved by his barber for
the occasion, but alas, the barber’s embellishments
can last but from day to day, and the rougher guise
of his life was betrayed in certain small habitudes,
conspicuous among which were an obliviousness of
many uses of a fork and an astonishing temerity
in the thrusting of his knife down his throat at
the dinner-table.</p>

<p>The two strangers appeared on the evening of
the dramatic entertainment among the other guests
of the hotel in the ballroom, as spectators of the
“Unrivaled Attraction” profusely billed in the
parlor, the office of the hotel, and the tenpin-alley.
The rain dashed tempestuously against the long
windows, and the sashes now and again trembled
and clattered in their frames, for the mountain
wind was rising. Ever and anon the white mist
that pressed with pallid presence against the panes
shivered convulsively, and was torn away into the
wild night and the savagery of the fastnesses without,
returning persistently, as if with some fatal affinity
for the bright lights and the warm atmosphere
that would annihilate its tenuous existence with but
a single breath. The blended sound of the torrents
and the shivering gusts was punctuated by the
slow dripping from the eaves of the covered walks
within the quadrangle close at hand, that fell with
monotonous iteration and elastic rebound from the
flagging below, and was of dreary intimations distinct
amid the ruder turmoil of the elements. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
a cheerful spirit pervaded the well-housed guests,
perhaps the more grateful for the provision for
pleasantly passing the long hours of a rainy evening
in the country, since it did not snatch them
from alternative pleasures; from languid strolls
on moonlit verandas, or contemplative cigars in
the perfumed summer woods under the stars, or
choice conferences with kindred spirits in the little
observatory that overhung the slopes. The Unrivaled
Attraction had been opportunely timed to
fill an absolute void, and it could not have been
presented before more leniently disposed spectators
than those rescued from the jaws of unutterable
ennui. There sounded a continuous subdued ripple
of laughter and stir of fans and murmur of talk
amongst them; but, although richly garbed in
compliment to the occasion, the brilliancy of their
appearance was somewhat reduced by the tempered
light in which it was essential that they should
sit throughout the performance and between the
acts, for the means at the command of the Unrivaled
Attraction were not capable of compassing
the usual alternations of illumination, and the
full and permanent glare of splendor was reserved
to suffuse the stage. The audience was itself an
object of intense interest to the actors behind
the scenes, and there was no interval in which the
small rent made in the curtain for the purpose
of observation was not utilized by one or another
of the excited youths, tremulous with premonitions
of a fiasco, from the time when the first groups<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
entered the hall to the triumphant moment when
it became evident that all New Helvetia was turning
out to honor the occasion, and that they
were to display their talents to a full house. It
was only when the stir of preparation became tumultuous—one
or two intimations of impatience
from the long-waiting audience serving to admonish
the performers—that Lucien Royce found an
opportunity to peer out in his turn upon the scene
in the dusky clare-obscure. Here and there the
yellow globes of the shaded lamps shed abroad
their tempered golden lustre, and occasionally
there came to his eye a pearly gleam from a fluttering
fan, or the prismatic glitter of a diamond,
or the ethereal suggestion of a girl in white in
the midst of such sombre intimations of red and
brown and deeply purple and black in the costumes
of the dark-robed elders that they might hardly be
accounted as definite color in the scale of chromatic
values. With such a dully rich background and
the dim twilight about her, the figure and face of
the girl he sought showed as if in the glamours of
some inherent light, reminding him of that illuminating
touch in the method of certain painters
whose works he had seen in art galleries, in which
the radiance seems to be in the picture, independent
of the skylight, and as if equally visible
in the darkest night. She wore a green dress
of some silken texture, so faint of hue that the
shadows of the soft folds appeared white. It was
fashioned with a long, slim bodice, cut square in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
the neck, and a high, flaring ruff of delicate old
lace, stiff with a Medici effect, that rose framing
the rounded throat and small head with its close
and high-piled coils of black hair, through which
was thrust a small comb of carved coral of the
palest possible hue. She might have been a picture,
so still and silent she sat, so definitely did
the light emanate from her, so completely did the
effect of the pale, lustrous tints of her attire reduce
to the vague nullities of a mere background the
nebulous dark and neutral shades about her. How
long Royce stood and gazed with all his heart in
his eyes he never knew. He saw naught else. He
heard naught of the stir of the audience, or the
wild wind without, or the babel upon the stage
where he was. He came to himself only when he
was clutched by the arm and admonished to clear
the track, for at last the curtain was to be rung
up.</p>

<p>What need to dwell on the tremulous eagerness
and wild despair of that moment,—the glee club
all ranged in order on the stage, and with heart-thumping
expectation, the brisk and self-sufficient
tinkle of the bell, the utter blank immovableness
of the curtain, the subdued delight of the audience?
Another tintinnabulation, agitated and querulous;
a mighty tug at the wings; a shiver in the fabric,
a sort of convulsion of the texture, and the curtain
goes up in slow doubt,—all awry and bias, it is
true, but still revealing the “musicianers,” a trifle
dashed and taken aback, but meeting a warm and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
reassuring reception which they do not dream is
partly in tribute to the clownish tricks of the curtain.</p>

<p>Royce, suddenly all in heart, exhilarated by the
mere sight of her, flung himself ardently into the
preparations progressing in the close little pens on
either side and at the rear of the stage. The
walls of these were mere partitions reaching up
only some ten feet toward the ceiling, and they
were devoid of any exit save through the stage
and the eye of the public. Hence it had been
necessary that all essentials should be carefully
looked to and provided in advance. Now and
then, however, a wild alarum arose because of the
apparent non-existence of some absolutely indispensable
article of attire or furniture, succeeded
by embarrassed silence on the part of the mourner
when the thing in question was found, and a meek
submission to the half-suppressed expletives of the
rest of the uselessly perturbed company. It was
a scene of mad turmoil. Young men already half
clad in feminine attire were struggling with the
remainder of their unaccustomed raiment,—the
actors to take part in the farce “The New Woman.”
Others were in their white flannel suits,—no
longer absolutely white,—hot, dusty, perspiring,
the scene-shifters and the curtain contingent,
all lugubriously wiping their heated brows
and blaming one another. The mandolin and
banjo players, in faultless evening dress, stood out
of the rush and kept themselves tidy. And now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
arose a nice question, in the discussion of which
all took part, becoming oblivious, for the time, of
the audience without and the tra-la-la-ing of the
glee singers, the boyish tones of argument occasionally
rising above these melodious numbers. It
was submitted that in case the audience should call
for the author of “The New Woman,”—and it
would indeed be unmannerly to omit this tribute,—the
playwright ought to be in full dress to respond,
considering the circumstances, the place,
and the full dress of the audience. And here he
was in his white flannel trousers and a pink-and-white
striped blazer at this hour of the night, and
his room a quarter of a mile away in a pitching
mountain rain, whither certain precisians would
fain have him hie to bedizen himself. He listened
to this with a downcast eye and a sinking heart,
and doubtless would have acted on the admonition
save for the ludicrous effect of emerging before
the audience as he was, and returning to meet the
same audience in the blaze of full-dress glory.</p>

<p>“It’s no use talking,” he said at last, decisively.
“We are caught here like rats in a trap. There
is no way of getting out without being seen. I
wonder I didn’t think to have a door cut.”</p>

<p>Repeatedly there rose on the air the voice of
one who was a slow study repeating the glib lines
of “The New Woman;” and once something very
closely approximating a quarrel ensued upon the
discovery that the budding author, already parsimonious
with literary material, had transferred a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
joke from the mouth of one character to that of
another; the robbed actor came in a bounding fury
and with his mother’s false hair, mildly parted and
waving away from his fierce, keen young face and
flashing eyes, to demand of the author-manager
its restoration. His decorous stiffly lined skirts
bounced tumultuously with his swift springs forward,
and his fists beneath the lace frill of his
sleeves were held in a belligerent muscular adjustment.</p>

<p>“It’s <i>my</i> joke,” he asseverated vehemently, as
if he had cracked it himself. “My speech is
ruined without it, world without end! I will have
it back! I will! I will!” he declared as violently
as if he could possess the air that would vibrate
with the voice of the actor who went on first, and
could put his collar on the syllables embodying the
precious jest by those masterful words, “I will!”</p>

<p>The manager had talents for diplomacy, as well
he should. He drew the irate antique-seeming
dame into the corner by the lace on the sleeve and,
looking into the wild boyish face, adjured him,
“Let him have it, Jack, for the love of Heaven.
He does it so badly, and he is such a slow study,
that I’m afraid the first act will break down if I
don’t give it some vim; after <i>you</i> are once on, the
thing will go and I shan’t care a red.”</p>

<p>And so with the dulcet salve of a little judicious
flattery peace came once more.</p>

<p>Royce, as he took his place upon the narrow
stage, felt as if he had issued from the tumultuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
currents of some wild rapids into the deep and
restful placidities of a dark untroubled pool. The
air of composure, the silence, the courteous attention
of the audience, all marked a transition so
abrupt that it had a certain perturbing effect. He
had never felt more ill at ease, and perhaps he had
never looked more composed than when he advanced
and stood bowing at the footlights. He had forgotten
his assumed character of a mountaineer, his
coarse garb, his intention to seek some manner
that might consist with both. He was inaugurating
his share of the little amateur entertainment
with a grace and address and refinement of style
that were astonishing his audience far more than
aught of magic that his art could command, although
his resources were not slight. He seemed
some well-bred and talented youth of the best society,
dressed for a rural rôle in private theatricals.
Now and again there was a flutter of inquiry
here and there in the audience, answered by
the whispered conclusions of Tom or Jack, retailed
by mother or sister. For the youth of New Helvetia
Springs had accepted the explanation that he
was out of a position, “down on his luck,” and
hoped to get a school in Etowah Cove. He had
gone by the sobriquet of “the handsome mountaineer,”
and then “the queer mountaineer,” and now,
“He is <i>no</i> mountaineer,” said the discerning Judge
Fordyce to a man of his own stamp at his elbow.</p>

<p>What might have been the estimate of the two
strangers none could say. They sat on opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
sides of the building, taking no note of each other,
both steadily gazing at the alert and graceful figure
and the handsome face alight with intelligence,
and made no sign. One might have been more
competent than the other to descry inconsistencies
between the status which the dress suggested and
the culture and breeding which the manner and
accent and choice of language betokened, but both
listened motionless as if absorbed in the prestidigitator’s
words.</p>

<p>Royce had made careful selection among his
feats in view of the character of his audience, and
the sustaining of such poor dignity as he might
hope to possess in Miss Fordyce’s estimation.
There were no uncouth tricks of swallowing impossible
implements of cutlery, which sooth to say
would have vastly delighted the row of juvenile
spectators on the front bench. Perhaps they were
as well content, however, with the appearance of
two live rabbits from the folds of the large white
silk handkerchief of an old gentleman in the crowd,
borrowed for the purpose, and the little boy who
came up to receive the article for restoration to its
owner went into an ecstasy of cackling delight,
with the whole front row in delirious refrain, to
find that he had one of the live rabbits in each of
the pockets of his jacket, albeit the juggler had
merely leaned over the footlights to hand him back
the handkerchief. The audience applauded with
hearty good will, and a general ripple of smiles
played over the upturned faces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>“Ladies and gentlemen,” said the juggler, picking
up a small and glittering object from the table,
“if I may ask your attention, you will observe that
each chamber of this revolver is loaded”—</p>

<p>With his long, delicate, deft white hands he had
turned aside the barrel, and now held the weapon
up, the two parts at right angles, each cartridge
distinctly visible to the audience.</p>

<p>But a sudden authoritative voice arose. “No
pistols!” called out a sober paterfamilias, responsible
for four boys in the audience.</p>

<p>“No pistols!” echoed Judge Fordyce.</p>

<p>There had been a momentary shrinking among
the ladies, whose curiosity, however, was greater
than their fear, and who sustained a certain doubtful
and disappointed aspect. But the shadowy
bullet-heads of the whole front row of small boys
were turned with one accord in indignant and unfilial
protest.</p>

<p>Royce understanding in a moment, with a quick
smile shifted all the cartridges out into his hand,
held up the pistol once more so that all might see
the light through the empty chambers of the cylinder,
then, with an exaggerated air of caution, laid
all the shells in a small heap on one of the little
tables and the pistol, still dislocated, on another
table, the breadth of the stage between them; and
with a satiric “Hey! Presto!” bowed, laughing
and complaisant, to a hearty round of applause
from the elders. For although his compliance
with their behests had been a trifle ironical, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
youths of New Helvetia were not accustomed to
submit with so good a grace or so completely.</p>

<p>The two elderly strangers accommodated the
expression of their views to the evident opinion of
those of their time of life, applauding when the
gentlemen about them applauded, maintaining an
air of interest when they were receptive and attentive.
Was it possible, one might wonder in looking
at them, that differences so essential could be
unremarked—that it was not patent to the most
casual observer that they had some far more serious
reason for their presence than the indulgent
laudation of the amateur entertainment which inspired
the friends and relatives of the youthful
performers? The perspicacity of the casual observer,
however, was hampered by the haze of the
pervasive obscurity; from the stage each might
seem to the transient glance merely a face among
many faces, the divergences of which could be discerned
only when some intention or interest informed
the gaze.</p>

<p>Lucien Royce saw only that oasis in the gloom
where the high lights of Miss Fordyce’s delicately
tinted costume shone in the dusk. He was keenly
mindful of a flash of girlish laughter, the softly
luminous glance of her eye, the glimmer of her
white teeth as her pink lips curled, the young delight
in her face. How should he care to note the
null, impassive countenance of the one man, the
grizzled stolid bourgeois aspect of the other?</p>

<p>The manager, keenly alive to the success of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
entertainment, advanced a number of the programme
since the pistol trick was discarded.
Having observed the fate of this from the wings,
he handed to Royce a flower-pot filled with earth
for a feat which it had been his intention to reserve
until after the first act of the play.</p>

<p>“Now, ladies and gentlemen,” said the juggler,
“oblige me by looking at this acorn. It is considered
quite harmless. True, it will shoot, too, if
you give it half a chance; but I am told,” with a
glance of raillery, “that its projectile effects are not
deleterious in any respect to the human anatomy.”</p>

<p>The ladies who had been afraid of the pistol
laughed delightedly, and the guyed elderly gentlemen
good-naturedly responded in another round of
applause, so grateful were they to have no shooting
on the stage, and no possible terrifying accidents
to their neighbors, themselves, and their respective
families.</p>

<p>“There is nothing but pulverized earth in this
flower-pot,” continued the juggler, running his
hand through the fine white sand, and shaking off
the particles daintily, “a little too sandy to suit
my views and experience in arboriculture, but we
shall see—what we shall see! I plant the acorn,
thus! I throw this cloth over the flower-pot,
drawing it up in a peak to give air. And now,
since we shall have to wait for a few moments, I
shall, with your kind indulgence, beguile the tedium,
in imitation of the jongleurs of eld, with a
little song.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>The audience sat patient, expectant. A guitar
was lying where one of the glee singers had left it.
Royce turned and caught it up, then advanced
down toward the footlights, and paused in the picturesque
attitude of the serenader of the lyric
stage. He drew from the instrument a few strong
resonant chords, and then it fell a-tinkling again.</p>

<p>But what new life was in the strings, what melody
in the air? And as his voice rose, the scene-shifters
were silent in the glare of the pens; the
actors thronged the wings; the audience sat spellbound.</p>

<p>No great display of art, to be sure! But the
mountain wilds were without, and the mountain
winds were abroad, and there was something
strangely sombre, romantic, akin to the suggestion
and the sound in the rich swelling tones of the
young voice so passionately vibrant on the air.
Though obviously an amateur, he sang with a careful
precision that bespoke fairly good advantages
amply improved, but the singing was instinct with
that ardor, that love of the art, that enthusiasm,
which no training can supply or create. The
music and the words were unfamiliar, for they
were his own. Neither was devoid of merit. Indeed,
a musical authority once said that his songs
would have very definite promise if it were not for
a determined effort to make all the science of harmony
tributary to the display of Lucien Royce’s
high <i>A</i>. A recurrent strain now and again came,
interfluent through the drift of melody, rising with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
a certain ecstatic elasticity to that sustained tone,
which was soft, yet strong, and as sweet as summer.</p>

<p>As his voice thus rang out into the silence with
all its pathos and its passion, he turned his eyes
on the eyes he had so learned to love, and met
those orbs, full of delight and of surprise and a
patent admiration, fixed upon his face. The rest
of the song he sang straight at Gertrude Fordyce,
and she looked at the singer, her gaze never swerving.
For once his plunging heart in triumph felt
he had caught and held her attention; for once,
he said to himself, she did not look at him as impersonally
as if he were the side of the wall.</p>

<p>It was over at last, and he was bowing his acknowledgments
to the wildly applauding audience.
The jugglery was at a discount. He had drawn
off the white cloth from the flower-pot, where a
strongly rooted young oak shoot two feet high
appeared to have grown while he sang. But the
walls of the room resounded with the turbulent
clamors of an insistent encore. Only the eyes of
the rustic-looking stranger were starting out of his
head as he gazed at the oak shoot, and there came
floating softly through his lips the involuntary
comment, “By gum!”</p>

<p>It was necessary in common courtesy to sing at
least the last stanza again, and as the juggler did
so he was almost happy in singing it anew to her
starry eyes, and noting the flush on her cheeks,
and the surprise and pleasure in her beautiful face.
The miracle of the oak shoot went unexplained,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
for all New Helvetia was still clapping a recall
when the juggler, bowing and bowing, with the
guitar in his hand, and ever retreating as he bowed,
stepped off at one of the wings for instructions,
and was met there by renewed acclamations from
his fellow entertainers.</p>

<p>“You’d better bring on the play if you don’t
want to hold forth here till the small hours,” he
said, flushed, and panting, and joyous once more.</p>

<p>But the author-manager was of a different mind.
The child of his fancy was dear to him, although
it was a very grotesque infant, as indeed it was
necessary that it should be. He deprecated submitting
it to the criticism of an unwilling audience,
still clamoring for the reappearance of another
attraction. However, there would not be time
enough to respond to this encore, and yet bring
the farce on with the deliberation essential to its
success, and the effect of all its little points.</p>

<p>“You seem to be the star of the evening,” he
said graciously. “And I should like to hear you
sing again myself. But we really haven’t time.
As they are so delighted with you, suppose, by
way of letting them down gently, we give them
another sight of you by moving up the basket trick
on the programme, instead of letting it come between
the second and third acts of the play,—we
have had to advance the feat that was to have
come between the first and second acts, anyhow,—and
have no jugglery between the acts.”</p>

<p>Royce readily agreed, but the manager still hesitated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
while the house thumped and clapped its
recall in great impatience, and a young hobbledehoy
slipped slyly upon the stage and facetiously
bowed <i>his</i> acknowledgments, with his hand upon
his heart, causing spasms of delight among the
juvenile contingent and some laughter from the
elders.</p>

<p>Said the hesitating manager, unconscious of
this interlude, “I don’t half like that basket trick.”</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded the juggler, surprised.
“It’s the best thing I can do. And when we
rehearsed it, I thought we had it down to a fine
point.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” still hesitating, “but I’m afraid it’s
dangerous.”</p>

<p>The juggler burst into laughter. “It’s as dangerous
as a pistol loaded with blank cartridges!
See here,” he cried joyously, turning with outspread
arms to the group of youths fantastic in
their stage toggery, “I call you all to witness—if
ever Millden Seymour hurts me, I intended to
let him do it. Come on!” he exclaimed in a different
tone. “I’m obliged to have a confederate in
this, and we have rehearsed it without a break
time and again.”</p>

<p>In a moment more they were on the stage, side
by side, and the audience, seeing that no more
minstrelsy was in order, became reconciled to the
display of magic. A certain new element of interest
was infused into the proceedings by the fact
that another person was introduced, and that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
was Seymour who made all the preparations, interspersing
them with jocular remarks to the audience,
while the juggler stood by, silent and acquiescent.
He seemed to be the victim of the manager,
in some sort, and the juvenile spectators, with
beating hearts and open mouths and serious eyes,
watched the proceedings taken against him as his
arms were bound with a rope and then a bag of
rough netting was slipped over him and sewed
up.</p>

<p>“I have him fast and safe now,” the manager
declared. “He cannot delude us with any more
of his deceits, I am sure.”</p>

<p>The juggler was placed at full length on the
floor and a white cloth was thrown over him. The
manager then exhibited a large basket with a top
to it, which he also thrust under the cloth. Taking
advantage of the evident partisanship of the
children for their entertainer, he spoke for a few
minutes in serious and disapproving terms of the
deceits of the eye, and made a very pretty moral
arraignment of these dubious methods of taking
pleasure, which was obviously received in high
dudgeon. He then turned about to lead his captive,
hobbled and bound, off the stage. Lifting
the cloth he found no trace of the juggler; the
basket with the top beside it was revealed, and
on the floor was the netting,—a complete case
with not a mesh awry through which he could have
escaped. The manager stamped about in the empty
basket and finally emerged putting on the top and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
cording it up. Whereupon one antagonistic youth
in the audience opined that the juggler was in the
basket.</p>

<p>“He is, is he?” said the manager, looking up
sharply at the bullet-headed row. “Then what
do you think of this, and this, and this?”</p>

<p>He had drawn the sharp bowie-knife with which
Royce had furnished him, and was thrusting it up
to the hilt here, there, everywhere through the
interstices of the wickerwork. This convinced the
audience that in some inscrutable manner the
juggler had been spirited away, impossible though
it might seem. The stage, in the full glare of all
the lamps at New Helvetia Springs, was in view
from every part of the house, and it was evident
that the management of the Unrivaled Attraction
was incapable of stage machinery, trap-doors, or
any similar appliance. In the midst of the discussion,
very general over the house, the basket began
to roll about. The manager viewed it with the
affectation of starting eyes and agitated terror for
a moment. Then, pouncing upon it in wrath, he
loosened the cords, took off the top, and pulled out
the juggler, who was received with acclamations,
and who retired, bowing and smiling And backing
off the stage, the hero of the occasion.</p>

<p>Seymour behind the scenes was giving orders
to ring down the curtain to prepare the stage for
“The New Woman.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do it unless you mean it for keeps,
Mill,” remonstrated the property-man. “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
devil’s in the old rag, I believe. It might not go
up again easily, and I’m sure, from the racket out
there, they are going to have the basket trick over
again.”</p>

<p>For the front row of bullet-heads was conducting
itself like a row of gallery gods, and effervescing
with whistlings and shrill cries. The applause
was general and tumultuous, growing louder
when the over-cautious father called out “No pistols
and <i>no knives</i>!”</p>

<p>“Oh, they can take care of themselves,” said a
former adherent of his proposition, for the feat
was really very clever, and very cleverly exploited,
and he was ready to accredit a considerable amount
of sagacity to youths who could get up so amusing
an entertainment. No one was alert to notice—save
his mere presence as some messenger or purveyor
of properties—a dazed-looking young mountaineer,
dripping with the rain, who walked down
the main aisle and stepped awkwardly over the
footlights, upon the stage. He paused bewildered
at the wings, and Lucien Royce behind the scenes,
turning, found himself face to face with Owen
Haines. The sight of the wan, ethereal countenance
brought back like some unhallowed spell the
real life he had lived of late into the vanishing
dream-life he was living now. But the actualities
are constraining. “You want me?” he said, with
a sudden premonition of trouble.</p>

<p>“I hev s’arched fur you-uns fur days,” Haines
replied, a strange compassion in his eyes, contemplating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
which Lucien Royce felt his blood go cold.
“But the Simses deceived me ez ter whar ye be;
they never told me till ter-night, an’ then I hed
ter tell ’em why I wanted you-uns.”</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded Royce, spellbound by the
look in the man’s eyes, and almost overmastered by
the revulsion of feeling in the last moment, the
quaking of an unnamed terror at his heart.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, with his acute and versatile faculties
he heard the clamors of the recall still thundering
in the auditorium, he noted the passing of
the facetiously bedight figures for the farce. He
was even aware of glances of curiosity from one or
two of the scene-shifters, and had the prudence to
draw Haines, who heard naught and saw only the
face before him, into a corner.</p>

<p>“Why?” reiterated Royce. “Why do you
want me?”</p>

<p>“Bekase,” said Haines, “Peter Knowles seen
ye fling them queer shoes an’ belt an’ clothes
inter the quicklime, an’ drawed the idee ez ye hed
slaughtered somebody bodaciously, an’ kivered ’em
thar too.”</p>

<p>The juggler reddened slightly at the mention of
the jaunty attire and the thought of its sacrifice,
but he was out of countenance before the sentence
was concluded, and gravely dismayed.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” he exclaimed, seeking to reassure
himself. “They would have to prove that
somebody is dead to make that charge stick.”</p>

<p>Then he realized the seriousness of such an accusation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
the necessity of accounting for himself
before a legal investigation, and this, to escape
one false criminal charge, must needs lead to a
prosecution for another equally false. The alternative
of flight presented itself instantly. “I can
explain later, if necessary, as well as now,” he
thought. “I’m a thousand times obliged to you
for telling me,” he added aloud, but to his amazement
and terror the man was wringing his hands
convulsively and his face was contorted with the
agony of a terrible expectation.</p>

<p>“Don’t thank me,” he said huskily. Then, with
a sudden hope, “Is thar enny way out’n this place
’ceptin’ yon?” he nodded his head toward the ballroom
on the other side of the partition.</p>

<p>“No, none,” gasped Royce, his nerves beginning
to comprehend the situation, while it still baffled
his brain.</p>

<p>“I’m too late, I’m too late!” exclaimed Haines
in a tense, suppressed voice. “The sher’ff’s thar,
’mongst the others, in that room. I viewed him
thar a minit ago.”</p>

<p>Assuming that he knew the worst, Royce’s courage
came back. With some wild idea of devising
a scheme to meet the emergency, he sprang upon
the vacant stage, on which the curtain had been
rung down despite the applause, still resolutely
demanding a repetition of the feat, and through
the rent in the trembling fabric swiftly surveyed
the house with a new and, alas, how different a
motive! His eyes instantly fixed upon the rustic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>
face, the hair parted far to the side, as the sheriff
vigorously stamped his feet and clapped his hands
in approbation. That oasis of refined, ideal light
where Miss Fordyce sat did not escape Royce’s attention
even at this crisis. Had he indeed brought
this sorry, ignoble fate upon himself that he might
own one moment in her thoughts, one glance of
her eye, that he might sing his song to her ear?
He had certainly achieved this, he thought sardonically.
She would doubtless remember him to the
last day she should live. He wondered if they
would iron him in the presence of the ladies.
Could he count upon his strong young muscles to
obey his will and submit without resistance when
the officers should lay their hands upon him, and
thus avoid a scene?</p>

<p>And all at once—perhaps it was the sweet look
in her face that made all gentle things seem possible—it
occurred to him that he despaired too
easily. An arrest might not be in immediate contemplation,—the
<i>corpus delicti</i> was impossible of
proof. He could surely make such disposition of
his own property as seemed to him fit, and the
explanation that he was at odds with his friends,
dead-broke, thrown out of business in the recent
panic, might pass muster with the rural officer,
since no crime could be discovered to involve the
destruction of the clothes. Thus he might still
remain unidentified with Lucien Royce, who pretended
to be dead and was alive, who had had in
trust a large sum of money in a belt which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
found upon another man, robbed, and perhaps murdered
for it. The sheriff of Kildeer County had
never dreamed of the like of that, he was very sure.</p>

<p>The next moment his heart sank like lead, for
there amongst the audience, quite distinct in the
glooms, was the sharp, keen, white face of a man
he had seen before,—a detective. It was but
once, yet, with that idea of crime rife in his mind,
he placed the man instantly. He remembered a
court-room in Memphis, during the trial of a certain
notable case, where he had chanced to loiter
in the tedium of waiting for a boat on one of his
trips through the city, and he had casually watched
this man as he gave his testimony. His presence
here was significant, conclusive, to be interpreted
far otherwise than any mission of the sheriff of the
county. Royce did not for one moment doubt that
it was in the interests of the Marble Company, the
tenants of the estate <i>per autre vie</i>, although the
criminal charge might emanate directly from the
firm whose funds had so mysteriously disappeared
from his keeping, whose trust must now seem so
basely betrayed. There was no possible escape;
the stanch walls of the building were unbroken
even by a window, and the only exit from behind
the partition was through the stage itself in full
view of the watchful eyes of the officers. Any
effort, any action, would merely accelerate the
climax, precipitate the shame of the arrest he
dreaded,—and in her presence! He felt how hard
the heart of the <i>cestui que vie</i> was thumping at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
prospect of the summary resuscitation. He said
to himself, with his ironical habit of mind, that he
had found dying a far easier matter. But there
was no responsive satire in the hunted look of his
hot, wild, glancing eyes, the quiver of every muscle,
the cold thrills that successively trembled through
the nervous fibres. He looked so unlike himself
for the moment, as he turned with a violent start
on feeling the touch of a hand on his arm, that
Seymour paused with some deprecation and uncertainty.
Then with a renewed intention the manager
said persuasively, “You won’t mind doing
it over again, will you? You see they won’t be
content without it.”</p>

<p>A certain element of surprise was blended with
the manager’s cogitations which he remembered
afterward rather than realized at the moment. It
had to do with the altered aspect of the man,—a
sudden grave tumultuous excitement which his
manner and glance bespoke; but the perception of
this was subacute in Seymour’s mind and subordinate
to the awkward dilemma in which he found
himself as manager of the little enterprise. There
was not time, in justice to the rest of the programme,
to repeat the basket trick, and had the
farce been the work of another he would have
rung the curtain up forthwith on its first scene.
But the pride and sensitiveness of the author forbade
the urging of his own work upon the attention
of an audience still clamorously insistent upon
the repetition of another attraction, and hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
likely, if balked of this, to be fully receptive to
the real merits of the little play.</p>

<p>Seymour remembered afterward, but did not
note at the time, the obvious effort with which the
juggler controlled his agitation. “Oh, anything
goes!” he assented, and in a moment more the
curtain had glided up with less than its usual convulsive
resistance. They were standing again together
with composed aspect in the brilliance of
the footlights, and Seymour, with a change of
phrase and an elaboration of the idea, was dilating
afresh upon the essential values of the positive in
life; the possible pernicious effects of any delusion
of the senses; the futility of finding pleasure in
the false, simply because of the flagrancy of its
falsity; the deleterious moral effects of such exhibitions
upon the very young, teaching them to
love the acrobatic lie instead of the lame truth,—from
all of which he deduced the propriety of tying
the juggler up for the rest of the evening. But
the bullet-heads were not as dense as they looked.
They learned well when they learned at all, and
the pauses of this rodomontade were filled with
callow chuckles and shrill whinnies of appreciative
delight, anticipative of the wonder to come. They
now viewed with eager forwarding interest the
juggler’s bonds, little dreaming what grim prophecy
he felt in their restraint, and the smallest
boy of the lot shrilly sang out, when all was done,
“Give him another turn of the rope!”</p>

<p>Seymour, his blond face flushed by the heat and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
his exertions to the hue of his pink-and-white
blazer, ostentatiously wrought another knot, and
down the juggler went on the floor, encased in the
unbroken netting; the cloth was thrown over the
man and the basket, and Seymour turned anew to
the audience and took up the thread of his discourse.
It came as trippingly off his tongue as
before, and in the dusky gray-purple haze, the
seeming medium in which the audience sat, fair,
smiling faces, full of expectation and attention,
looked forth their approval, and now and again
broke into laughter. When, having concluded by
announcing that he intended to convey the discomfited
juggler off the stage, he found naught under
the cloth but the empty net without a mesh awry,
the man having escaped, his rage was a trifle more
pronounced than before. With a wild gesture he
tossed the net out to the spectators to bid them
observe how the villain had outwitted him, and
then sprang into the basket and stamped tumultuously
all around in the interior, evidently covering
every square inch of its surface, while the detective’s
keen eyes watched with an eager intensity,
as if the only thought in his mind concerned the
miracle of the juggler’s withdrawal. Out Seymour
plunged finally, and with dogged resolution
he put the lid on and began to cord up the basket
as if for departure.</p>

<p>“Save the little you’ve got left,” whinnied out
a squirrel-toothed mouth from the front bench,
almost too broadly a-grin for articulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>“Get a move on ye,—get a move!” shouted
another of the callow youngsters, reveling in the
fictitious plight of the discomfited manager as if it
were real.</p>

<p>He seemed to resent it. He looked frowningly
over the footlights at the front row, as it hugged
itself and squirmed on the bench and cackled in
ecstasy.</p>

<p>“I wish I had him here!” he exclaimed gruffly.
“I’d settle him—with this—and this—and
this!” Each word was emphasized with the successive
thrusts of the sharp blade of the bowie-knife
through the wickerwork.</p>

<p>“That’s enough! That’s enough!” the remonstrant
elderly gentleman in the audience admonished
him, and he dropped the blade and came
forward to beg indulgence for the unseemly and
pitiable position in which he found himself placed.
He had barely turned his back for a moment,
when this juggler whom he had taken so much
pains to secure, in order to protect the kind and
considerate audience from further deceits of a
treacherous art, mysteriously disappeared, and
whither he was sure he could not imagine. He
hesitated for a moment and looked a trifle embarrassed,
for this was the point at which the
basket should begin to roll along the floor. He
gave it a covert glance, but it was motionless where
he had left it. Raising his voice, he repeated the
words as with indignant emphasis, thinking that
the juggler had not caught the cue. He went on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
speaking at random, but his words came less freely;
the audience sat expectant; the basket still lay
motionless on the floor. Seeing that he must needs
force the crisis, he turned, exclaiming with uplifted
hands, “Do my eyes deceive me, or is that
basket stirring, rolling on the floor?”</p>

<p>But no; the basket lay as still as he had left it.
There was a moment of tense silence in the audience.
His face grew suddenly white and chill, his
eyes dilated—fixed on something dark, and slow,
and sinuous, trickling down the inclined plane of
the stage. He sprang forward with a shrill exclamation,
and, catching up the bowie-knife, severed
with one stroke the cords that bound the basket.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” he gasped in a tremulous
voice to the silence beneath the lid, and as he
tossed it aside he recoiled abruptly, rising to his
feet with a loud and poignant cry, “Oh, my God!
he is dead! he is dead!”</p>

<p>The sudden transition from the purely festival
character of the atmosphere to the purlieus of grim
tragedy told heavily on every nerve. There was
one null moment blank of comprehension, and
then women were screaming, and more than one
fainted; the clamor of overturned benches added
to the confusion, as the men, with grim set faces
and startled eyes, pressed forward to the stage;
the children cowered in mute affright close below
the footlights, except one small creature who
thought it a part of the fun, not dreaming what
death might be, and was laughing aloud in high-keyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>
mirth down in the dusky gloom. A physician
among the summer sojourners, on a flying visit
for a breath of mountain air, was the first man to
reach the stage, and, with the terror-stricken Seymour,
drew the long lithe body out and straightened
it on the floor, as the curtain was lowered to
hide the ghastly <i>mise en scène</i> which it might be
terror to women and children to remember. His
ready hand desisted after a glance. The man had
died from the first stroke of the bowie-knife, penetrating
his side, and doubtless lacerating the outer
tissues of the heart. The other strokes were registered,—the
one on his hand, the other, a slight
graze, on the neck. A tiny package had fallen on
the floor as the hasty hands had torn the shirt
aside from the wound: the deft professional fingers
unfolded it,—a bit of faded flower, a wild purple
verbena; the physician looked at it for a moment,
and tossed it aside in the blood on the floor, uninterested.
The pericardium was more in his line.
He was realizing, too, that he could not start to-morrow,
as he had intended, for his office and his
rounds among his patients. The coroner’s jury
was an obstinate impediment, and his would be
expert testimony.</p>

<p>Upon this inquest, held incongruously enough
in the ballroom, the facts of the information which
Owen Haines had brought to the juggler and the
presence of the officers in the audience were elicited,
and added to the excitements incident to the
event. The friends of young Seymour, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
overwhelmed by the tragedy, believed and contended
that since escape from prosecution for some
crime was evidently impossible, the juggler had in
effect committed suicide by holding up his left
arm that the knife might pierce a vital part. Thus
they sought to avert the sense of responsibility
which a man must needs feel for so terrible a deed
wrought, however inadvertently, by his own hand.
But crime as a factor seemed doubtful. The
sheriff, indeed, upon the representations of Sims,
supplemented by the mystery of the lime-kiln
which Knowles had disclosed, had induced the
detective to accompany him to the mountains to
seek to identify the stranger as a defaulting cashier
from one of the cities for whose apprehension a
goodly amount of money would be paid. But in
no respect did Royce correspond to the perpetrator
of any crime upon the detective’s list.</p>

<p>“He needn’t have been afraid of me,” he observed
dryly; “I saw in a minute he wasn’t our
fellow. And I was just enjoying myself mightily.”</p>

<p>The development of the fact of the presence of
the officers and the juggler’s knowledge that they
were in the audience affected the physician’s testimony
and his view of the occurrence. He accounted
it an accident—the nerve of the young
man, shaken by the natural anxiety at finding
himself liable to immediate arrest, was not sufficient
to carry him through the feat; he failed to
shift position with the celerity essential to the
basket trick, and the uplifting of the arm, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>
left the body unprotected to receive the blow, was
but the first effort to compass the swift movements
necessary to the feat. The unlucky young manager
was exonerated from all blame in the matter,
but the verdict was death by accident.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, throughout all the years since, the
argument continues. Along the verge of those
crags overlooking the valley, in the glamours of
a dreamy golden haze, with the amethystine mountains
on the horizon reflecting the splendors of the
sunset sky, and with the rich content of the summer
solstice in the perfumed air; or amongst the
ferns about the fractured cliffs whence the spring
wells up with a tinkling tremor and exhilarant
freshness and a cool, cool splashing as of the veritable
fountain of youth; or in the shadowy twilight
of the long, low building where the balls go
crashing down the alleys; or sometimes even in
the ballroom in pauses of the dance when the
music is but a plaint, half-joy, half-pain, and the
wind is singing a wild and mystic refrain, and the
moonlight comes in at the windows and lies in
great blue-white silver rhomboids on the floor despite
the dull yellow glow of the lamps,—in all
these scenes which while yet in life Lucien Royce
haunted, with a sense of exile and a hopeless severance,
as of a man who is dead, the mystery of
his fate revives anew and yet once more, and continues
unexplained. Conjecture fails, conclusions
are vain, the secret remains. Hey! Presto! The
juggler has successfully exploited his last feat.</p>
